# San Francisco Day of Civic Hacking 

San Francisco Day of Civic Hacking (SFDoCH) at SF State, part of National Day of Civic Hacking, took place May 31 â€“ June 1, 2014. The event brings together citizens, software developers, and entrepreneurs together to collaboratively create, build, and invent new solutions using publicly-released data, code and technology to improve our communities and the governments that serve them. 

We got the First Prize with this project whose name is Peace Corps Peace.
