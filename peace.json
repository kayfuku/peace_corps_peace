As a community environmental education promoters, Volunteers work at the community level in coordination with teachers, community associations and government, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Volunteers are currently concentrated in five departments: León, Chinandega, Boaco, Rivas, and Matagalpa.  <br><br>Nicaragua’s private, public, and non-profit sectors are concerned about the country’s rapid rate of deforestation and soil erosion that has taken place over the last 25 years. The deforestation is the result of subsistence (slash and burn) farming combined with a growing, market-based agricultural sector, woodcutting and charcoal production to produce traditional fuels. These problems are compounded due to the fact that natural resources are poorly utilized and basic, government-provided services are limited. Community initiatives to address these problems are inhibited by the low income of rural inhabitants and a lack of education related to environmental issues. <br><br>The Community Environmental Education Project has a formal agreement with MINED and as partners our organizations have the following framework.  The project's purpose is: \"To facilitate the sustainable management of communities’ natural resources through education and community action in order to conserve the local environment and improve peoples’ livelihoods.\" Community Environmental Education Volunteers will be assigned to work with three local elementary schools. The activities they develop will work towards this purpose by focusing on the following goals:<br><br>GOAL 1:  Rural school teachers will improve their technical skills to teach environmental education and primary school students will increase their knowledge and skills to conserve natural resources in their communities. <br>Volunteers implement the following tasks to meet this goal:<br>1. Classroom co-teaching: Volunteers demonstrate and model participatory approaches and the inclusion of environmental topics in all courses. Volunteers co-teach in public primary schools, co-plan and train teachers in participatory, community-level environmental activities to achieve this. Methodologies: classroom management, positive reinforcement, community research activities.<br>2. Environmental-technical activities: trash separation, gardening techniques, composting, nursery establishment. <br>3. Composting, Gardening Activities, and nurseries: Volunteers train teachers in practical skills to carry out these activities in the school.<br>GOAL 2: Community-Based groups and organizations will have improved their technical and organizational capacity and implemented projects to conserve the local environment.<br>Volunteers participate in the following development activities to meet this goal:<br>1.Support community organizations in their sites: Volunteers support parent organizations, ecological brigades and/or local environmental commissions to improve their organizational capacity (i.e. annual plans, local coordination with other organizations). <br>2.Youth ecological brigade training: Volunteers will train and facilitate the organization of groups working towards local community environmental issues.  The brigades/clubs are formed by Nicaraguan youth, ages 10-17. Activity examples include trash campaigns in the school(s) and in the community to reduce organic solid waste, environmental awareness campaigns related to the importance of sustainable household water use and celebration of World Environmental Day (June 5).<br>3.Environmental conservation activities: environmental talks, establishment of small community fruit/wood trees nurseries or vegetable gardens with composting, reforestation campaigns, ecological/educational murals, and/or proper trash disposal.",

  "project_description_project_description" : "The goal of the agriculture extension project is to motivate Paraguayan small-scale farmers and their families to optimize their use of available human, material, and natural resources in order to raise their standard of living and to improve food security. Tasks: The work of agriculture extension Volunteers is based on a project plan designed to train farm families in the specific areas of soil management, crop diversification, improved nutrition and holistic sustainable farming-permaculture. Volunteers must assist rural communities to address locally identified needs and interests by serving as a link between the community and the human and material resources available to them on a national level. Also, Volunteers use participatory analysis tools to help farmers and community members identify and prioritize and solve their problems. Your principle objectives will be to assist farm families and individuals in understanding and implementing comprehensive sustainable food production systems which can be used both for increased consumption as well as income generation. Each of these tasks addresses critical problems in rural Paraguay. Establishing links between a community and available resources is the true basis of community-based development, whereby community members learn to identify and address their own needs as they perceive them. The primary technical focus of the work performed by agriculture extension Volunteers is related to the priority needs and interests of Paraguayan farm families: soil management, income generation, and the assurance of food availability. Soil management practices include use of green manure, crop rotation, no-till farming, and contour plowing. At all times, you will help farm families identify alternative sources of food production and other income generating activities for their farms. One important change, there will no longer be a specific Beekeeping component of the project, rather beekeeping will be an activity merged with the entire project. All invitees will receive a basic training in managing hives, but not all will be expected to keep bees in site. Invitees with previous beekeeping experience are welcome, but they will not be working bees 100% of the time, rather it will be part of a holistic approach to agriculture extension and seen as a component of the rural Paraguayan farmer's farm management strategy.

A few internet cafes exist in some larger towns,, but access is slow, patchy and dependent on unreliable electricity.   There is access at the PC office, and in our two transit houses.

  "project_description_project_description" : "The goal of the agriculture extension project is to motivate Paraguayan small-scale farmers and their families to optimize their use of available human, material, and natural resources in order to raise their standard of living and to improve food security. Tasks: The work of agriculture extension Volunteers is based on a project plan designed to train farm families in the specific areas of soil management, crop diversification, improved nutrition and holistic sustainable farming-permaculture. Volunteers must assist rural communities to address locally identified needs and interests by serving as a link between the community and the human and material resources available to them on a national level. Also, Volunteers use participatory analysis tools to help farmers and community members identify and prioritize and solve their problems. Your principle objectives will be to assist farm families and individuals in understanding and implementing comprehensive sustainable food production systems which can be used both for increased consumption as well as income generation. Each of these tasks addresses critical problems in rural Paraguay. Establishing links between a community and available resources is the true basis of community-based development, whereby community members learn to identify and address their own needs as they perceive them. The primary technical focus of the work performed by agriculture extension Volunteers is related to the priority needs and interests of Paraguayan farm families: soil management, income generation, and the assurance of food availability. Soil management practices include use of green manure, crop rotation, no-till farming, and contour plowing. At all times, you will help farm families identify alternative sources of food production and other income generating activities for their farms. One important change, there will no longer be a specific Beekeeping component of the project, rather beekeeping will be an activity merged with the entire project. All invitees will receive a basic training in managing hives, but not all will be expected to keep bees in site. Invitees with previous beekeeping experience are welcome, but they will not be working bees 100% of the time, rather it will be part of a holistic approach to agriculture extension and seen as a component of the rural Paraguayan farmer's farm management strategy.

This emphasis enhances your ability to get to know a few communities very well. <br><br>Peace Corps urban and peri-urban agriculture Volunteers are assigned primarily to Senegal's Horticulture direction (department) within the Ministry of Agriculture. As a member of a Peace Corps project team, you will be responsible, along with your host-country and Volunteer counterparts, for participating actively in the creation of work plans for your community and for yourself, monitoring and expanding the work of previous Volunteers, and maintaining a documentation system for your urban and peri-urban zone that includes reports, baseline information, and other documents. You will be required to attend monthly planning meetings with the other Volunteers in your region and to work in close collaboration with your colleagues. <br><br>Peace Corps/ Senegal's program philosophy is based on an approach which emphasizes demonstration, extension, and the exchange of ideas. Depending on the conditions in the city, the ecology and farming system of your peri-urban area of assignment, you can expect to be working on many of the following activities: <br><br>-Increasing city and peri-urban levels of vegetable, flower, herb or field crop production by promoting the usage of appropriate, improved variety seed and their associated agricultural practices; <br><br>-Extending improved field crop seed along with improved farming practices; <br><br>-Protecting vegetable, flower, herb or field crop production areas from insect and pest damage, through the promotion of sustainable agricultural means, such as Integrated Pest Management (IPM); <br><br>-Increasing soil fertility through the promotion of sustainable organic means, such as composting, manure tea, etc.; <br>-Protecting the vegetable, flower, herb and crop production areas from animal and wind damage through the promotion of sustainable agricultural means, such as live fencing and windbreaks; <br><br>- Increasing the production of market-quality vegetables, flowers and herbs for sale and home consumption; <br><br>- Increasing animal protein availability through the extension of small poultry raising techniques; <br><br>-Developing individual and organizational capacities at the city level; and <br><br>-Promoting improved seed selection, storage, and handling techniques.",

  "living_conditions_comments_condition_comments" : "As a volunteer, you will receive a monthly living allowance sufficient to live at a modest level in your community, and a settling-in allowance to defray the initial costs of setting up a household. You will live in a two or three-room house, most likely in a compound with a Togolese family. Some volunteer houses have tin roofs; others have straw or thatched roofs. You may not have running water or electricity at your post. Water sources in villages could be traditional wells, a borehole equipped with a pump, cisterns, a natural water source, and even rivers. Whatever your source of drinking water, you will have to treat it before use. This is critical for your well-being and will be explained to you fully during your PST.  \n\nA typical Togolese meal is a corn, millet or yam paste, accompanied by a hot, spicy sauce. You will learn to cook throughout the PST and you will be encouraged to cook for yourself.\n\nDistances from PCV posts to prefectural and regional capitals range between zero and eighty kilometers. Some volunteers like biking these distances; others prefer local public transportation (bush taxis) to the nearest mail point, bank, and shopping locations. Given the inherent risks of travel by bush taxi, Peace Corps Togo works closely with volunteers to develop strategies that minimize the need to travel long distances. Peace Corps/Togo uses a mini-bus twice a month to transport PCVs from the northernmost city to/from Lomé.  All Volunteers are equipped with a mountain bike that is their primary means of transportation. There is a regular weekly Express Mail Service (EMS) between Lomé and mail points throughout Togo for volunteers.  Besides EMS, volunteers have post office boxes (individually or as a group).\n\nIn some regions, excessive drinking of alcohol may be culturally accepted and quite common among males in the community. Male volunteers, especially, might be faced with considerable pressure to join in the drinking.  If you have a problem with alcohol, you may want to consider whether or not you should put yourself in a situation where you might have to deal with somewhat constant and compelling pressure to drink. Excessive drinking is discouraged for many reasons including your health, safety and ability to be a respected member in your community and effective in your work.\n\nIn general, American volunteers are well appreciated and respected in Togo for their easy integration into communities.  You will make friends among your collaborators or within the community. You will find some collaborators and some villagers immediately motivated for work. You will need motivation skills and cross-cultural understanding to work effectively with others.",

  "project_description_project_description" : "The goal of the agriculture extension project is to motivate Paraguayan small-scale farmers and their families to optimize their use of available human, material, and natural resources in order to raise their standard of living and to improve food security. Tasks: The work of agriculture extension Volunteers is based on a project plan designed to train farm families in the specific areas of soil management, crop diversification, improved nutrition and holistic sustainable farming-permaculture. Volunteers must assist rural communities to address locally identified needs and interests by serving as a link between the community and the human and material resources available to them on a national level. Also, Volunteers use participatory analysis tools to help farmers and community members identify and prioritize and solve their problems. Your principle objectives will be to assist farm families and individuals in understanding and implementing comprehensive sustainable food production systems which can be used both for increased consumption as well as income generation. Each of these tasks addresses critical problems in rural Paraguay. Establishing links between a community and available resources is the true basis of community-based development, whereby community members learn to identify and address their own needs as they perceive them. The primary technical focus of the work performed by agriculture extension Volunteers is related to the priority needs and interests of Paraguayan farm families: soil management, income generation, and the assurance of food availability. Soil management practices include use of green manure, crop rotation, no-till farming, and contour plowing. At all times, you will help farm families identify alternative sources of food production and other income generating activities for their farms. One important change in the QTRS, there will no longer be a specific Beekeeping component of the project, rather beekeeping will be an activity merged with the entire project. All invitees will receive a basic training in managing hives, but not all will be expected to keep bees in site. Invitees with previous beekeeping experience are welcome, but they will not be working bees 100% of the time, rather it will be part of a holistic approach to agriculture extension and seen as a component of the rural Paraguayan farmer's farm management strategy.

Volunteers work in close collaboration with Zambia's Department of Fisheries to assist this department achieve its goal of improving the rural livelihoods through fish farming. Volunteers live in villages among rural farming communities and provide intensive extension services aimed at increasing farmer capacities to successfully build and manage fishponds so that they can increase production and incomes.  During extension visits, PCVs teach and assist farmers in technical aspects that include site selection, pond construction, stocking, management and harvesting. The PCVs seek to enhance the integration of fish farming with other agricultural activities such as gardening, animal husbandry, fruit trees, and agro-forestry. For farmers who are interested in scaling up their activity, Volunteers also provide training in basic business skills such as planning, record keeping and marketing. As most farmers belong to aquaculture cooperatives or associations, Volunteers are involved in strengthening the organizational capacity of such local groups through providing training in aspects such as needs assessment, action planning, organizational structure, leadership and project implementation.<br>.<br><br>Trainees are required to provide certified true copies of their university diplomas, to the country desk, immediately upon acceptance and clearance for this assignment.

  "living_conditions_comments_condition_comments" : "The Gambia is in the bottom 10% of the UNDP Development Index.  80% of PCVs are assigned to communities without electricity.  Most living conditions are fairly austere, transport is limited and medical facilities in the country are very basic.  Volunteers must be able to carry water containers (up to 25 lbs), for 10 minutes if necessary, and be able to walk up to 5 kilometres and cycle up to 10 kilometres, although there are a very small number of placements in the urban area where these conditions do not apply to the same extent.Few sites have access to the internet.  A few internet cafes exist in some larger towns,, but access is slow, patchy and dependent on unreliable electricity.   There is access at the PC office, and in our two transit houses. Communications between PC staff and volunteers as well as among volunteers, is mainly by phone and text, and all trainees receive a cell phone on arrival.  This generally works very well, despite a few network issues.  As an example, in the last EAP test, almost 90% of volunteers were reached in under 4 hours.  \n\n\n\nMany vegetarians have managed to maintain a healthy diet here.  However, as the supply and range of vegetables in the country is limited, this can present challenges and requires some flexibility. It is very difficult for volunteers to persist with a vegan diet through their service. \n\n\n\nThe Gambia is a small country. Partly as a result of that, contact between staff and volunteers is high.  PC staff pride themselves on the support they provide to volunteers, and this is well appreciated by the volunteer community.\n\n\n\nDiversity issues - The Gambia is conservative by U.S. standards, and many Gambians disapprove of homosexuality.  Because of this, gay, lesbian, and bisexual volunteers have not been able to be open about their sexual orientation. However, Peace Corps The Gambia provides an open and supportive atmosphere for gay, lesbian, and bisexual volunteers.<br><br>Gambians are very welcoming and generous.  However, many, especially in the rural areas, have little knowledge of the wider world.  As a result, they often base their assumptions on very stereotypical images.  For example, they may assume that all Asian Americans are of Chinese origin, or that African Americans should understand Gambian culture or even language.  Gambian women, especially in rural areas, have very traditional roles. As a result, North American women may not be able to exercise the freedoms to which they are accustomed.  This being said, most volunteers are able to adapt to local expectations, and are happily integrated into their communities.",

  "living_conditions_comments_condition_comments" : "The Gambia is in the bottom 10% of the UNDP Development Index.  80% of PCVs are assigned to communities without electricity.  Most living conditions are fairly austere, transport is limited and medical facilities in the country are very basic.  Volunteers awill be staying with host families; they must be able to carry water containers (up to 25 lbs), for 10 minutes if necessary, and be able to walk up to 5 kilometres and cycle up to 10 kilometres. Only a few, if any placements will be in the urban area where these conditions do not apply to the same extent.Few sites have access to the internet.  A few internet cafes exist in some larger towns,, but access is slow, patchy and dependent on unreliable electricity.   There is access at the PC office, and in our two transit houses. Communications between PC staff and volunteers as well as among volunteers, is mainly by phone and text, and all trainees receive a cell phone on arrival.  This generally works very well, despite a few network issues.  As an example, in the last EAP test, almost 90% of volunteers were reached in under 4 hours.  \n\n\n\nMany vegetarians have managed to maintain a healthy diet here.  However, as the supply and range of vegetables in the country is limited, this can present challenges and requires some flexibility. It is very difficult for volunteers to persist with a vegan diet through their service. \n\n\n\nThe Gambia is a small country. Partly as a result of that, contact between staff and volunteers is high.  PC staff pride themselves on the support they provide to volunteers, and this is well appreciated by the volunteer community.\n\n\n\nDiversity issues - The Gambia is conservative by U.S. standards, and many Gambians disapprove of homosexuality. Because of this, gay, lesbian, and bisexual volunteers have not been able to be open about their sexual orientation. However, Peace Corps The Gambia provides an open and supportive atmosphere for gay, lesbian, and bisexual volunteers. Gambians are very welcoming and generous. However, many, especially in the rural areas, have little knowledge of the wider world. As a result, they often base their assumptions on very stereotypical images. For example, they may assume that all Asian Americans are of Chinese origin, or that African Americans should understand Gambian culture or even language. Gambian women, especially in rural areas, have very traditional roles. As a result, North American women may not be able to exercise the freedoms to which they are accustomed. This being said, most volunteers are able to adapt to local expectations, and are happily integrated into their communities.",

Examples of placements include a locally-based independent NGO, locally-based branches of national-level NGOs, local branches of World Vision, local units of a central government institution, and local NGOs which work on cultural heritage. The first five groups of community developers were placed in a spectrum of organizations within the broad realm of community development activities. Current project activities are focused in several key areas: municipal development, NGO development, business development, tourism/cultural development and preservation, and capacity-building in the area of information and communications management and technology.\n\n\n\nIn all realms of the Community and Organization Development project, the capacity-building of your coworkers and promotion of organizational development are primary areas of intervention.  Many workers in local organizations have received various types of training over the past several years – but they are challenged to apply the knowledge received to actually improve internal systems or implement projects.  In all cases, the volunteer's role will likely involve working one-to-one with a few individuals to assist them in applying the training they’ve received to a local situation.\n\n\n\nIf volunteers have a business background, they might be placed with, and/or collaborate with a department of local government that deals with Economic Development or a unit of the local government, such as the local Directorate of Agriculture, Food and Consumer Protection. Volunteers may also be placed with a micro-finance organization, with branches of communal level credit unions, or possibly in a micro-lending institution. In these organizations, the volunteer's role will be to develop the capacity of the staff working within these institutions, as well as to promote capacity building among their small business clients. Business Development Volunteers may also be assigned to regional development agencies, local branches of development or civil society organizations, humanitarian groups or schools, all of which will offer opportunities for locally-based capacity building in the area of business development. Business development Volunteers might target youth and work to increase their capacities in starting up businesses, developing their entrepreneurial skills, etc. \n\n\n\nDepending on the specific placement, the volunteer's role may be to work in partnership with the key actors in the community, to build the capacity of local institutions, or to increase the involvement of citizens and youth in local decision-making. The volunteer may facilitate collaborative activities between local non-governmental organizations, businesses, and citizen groups. He/she may provide assistance to all sectors of the community in strategic planning or in project design and management. He/she may also support the development of non-governmental organizations, and youth groups, depending on locally- identified needs.",

  "project_description_project_description" : "As a Community and Organizational Development Volunteer, you may be placed with either a local government unit (Municipality/Commune/Regional Council) or one of a variety of different community-based organizations. Examples of placements include a locally-based independent NGO, locally-based branches of national-level NGOs, local branches of World Vision, local units of a central government institution, and local NGOs which work on cultural heritage. The first five groups of community developers were placed in a spectrum of organizations within the broad realm of community development activities. Current project activities are focused in several key areas: municipal development, NGO development, business development, tourism/cultural development and preservation, and capacity-building in the area of information and communications management and technology. In all realms of the Community and Organization Development project, the capacity-building of your coworkers and promotion of organizational development are primary areas of intervention. Many workers in local organizations have received various types of training over the past several years – but they are challenged to apply the knowledge received to actually improve internal systems or implement projects. In all cases, the volunteer's role will likely involve working one-to-one with a few individuals to assist them in applying the training they’ve received to a local situation. If volunteers have a business background, they might be placed with, and/or collaborate with a department of local government that deals with Economic Development or a unit of the local government, such as the local Directorate of Agriculture, Food and Consumer Protection. Volunteers may also be placed with a micro-finance organization, with branches of communal level credit unions, or possibly in a micro-lending institution. In these organizations, the volunteer's role will be to develop the capacity of the staff working within these institutions, as well as to promote capacity building among their small business clients. Business Development Volunteers may also be assigned to regional development agencies, local branches of development or civil society organizations, humanitarian groups or schools, all of which will offer opportunities for locally-based capacity building in the area of business development. Business development Volunteers might target youth and work to increase their capacities in starting up businesses, developing their entrepreneurial skills, etc. Depending on the specific placement, the volunteer's role may be to work in partnership with the key actors in the community, to build the capacity of local institutions, or to increase the involvement of citizens and youth in local decision-making. The volunteer may facilitate collaborative activities between local non-governmental organizations, businesses, and citizen groups. He/she may provide assistance to all sectors of the community in strategic planning or in project design and management. He/she may also support the development of non-governmental organizations, and youth groups, depending on locally- identified needs.",

Following the first three months at site, PCVs may choose to stay with their host family, or to identify a separate housing option. This may be a room in another family’s home, a connected apartment, or a separate apartment. However, in many remote sites there is often a scarcity of independent housing options, and therefore most PCVs in Georgia live with a host family throughout their service.

Peace Corps Nicaragua also collaborates with other NGOs and community groups to reach the high number of out-of school youth.\n\n\n\nRecognizing that small businesses form an integral part of the nation’s economy and in light of globalization and various trade agreements, the Small Business Development Project will continue helping interested micro/small business owners and entrepreneurs to improve productivity and competitiveness. We do this by motivating, inspiring, and assisting them in the development of their business plans as well as the application of sound business planning and management techniques. The project will provide current and prospective small business owners and entrepreneurs with the knowledge and skills needed to take advantage of economic opportunities, secure employment, and/or generate income.\n\n\n\nThe focus of the Volunteer’s work will be transmitting knowledge and developing the abilities and skills of business people, and community groups wishing to improve their quality of life through the promotion of sustainable economic activities.  \n\n\n\nA cross-cutting element the project hopes to boost between the two components is the establishment of strong linkages between the public, private, and university sectors in the community to provide opportunities for youth such as mentoring, internships, job placement, and scholarship opportunities.  Volunteers will be encouraged to work with their community to organize a career and/or college fair in their sites to increase opportunity awareness amongst the youth in the area.\n\n\n\nAs their primary assignment, all Small Business Volunteers receive the same training and will be required to co-teach an entrepreneurial education course in public high school and vocational school classrooms with as many as 60 students as their primary assignment.  All Volunteers in this program must be willing to teach youth entrepreneurial and life skills in high school classrooms at least half time M-F, plus weekly planning, monitoring, and evaluating progress in close coordination with Nicaraguan teachers.  Educational activities include: basic business skills via a Junior Achievement-type curriculum, employability skills, utilizing information technology, etc.\n\n\n\nIn addition to teaching the entrepreneurial education course, these Volunteers will also be engaged in providing technical assistance and business advising training for small business owners as well as establishing linkages between the youth and local organizations, universities and other institutions promoting entrepreneurship.

  "living_conditions_comments_condition_comments" : "Site Placements: Candidates should be aware that all site placements are in rural areas, which means that their access to many resources will be limited. All COED Volunteers have access to regular public transportation (for travel within their department), but the frequency of public transportation can vary greatly (from buses every 30 minutes to buses only on certain days of the week). Access to internet and other information resources may be limited, and given the rural placements, many Volunteers use latrines instead of indoor bathrooms.\n\n\n\nMinorities: El Salvador may be challenging for minorities because initially they are generally not viewed as Americans. This can be especially true for African-American and Asian-American PCVs.\n\n\n\nTerrain: Candidates should be aware that El Salvador is a mountainous country and site placements are in rural areas, which means there may be uneven terrain. \n\n\n\nClimate: Traditionally, El Salvador has had a tropical climate with well defined wet and dry seasons. The wet season (invierno) lasts approximately from May to October with heavy afternoon thunderstorms, and the dry season (verano) lasts from November to April, with high winds common November through January. Temperatures generally depend on altitude. In the hotter lowlands,  high temperatures can reach well into the mid- to high 30s °C (over 95 °F). On the central plateau, highs can be above 30 °C (over 85 °F) and lows may occasionally dip below 10 °C (under 50 °F). In the highlands, temperatures generally range from 12 to 23 °C (approximately 54 to 73 °F) but lows can drop below freezing.\n\n\n\nHome-stay: All Volunteers are required to live with a family during Pre-Service Training and for the duration of their service.\n\n\n\nDiet: While it is very possible to be vegetarian and/or vegan in El Salvador, it can be a challenge, and individuals will need to think through their personal strategies to maintain their diet. (This also applies to Volunteers with other special dietary considerations.) In general, protein is consumed in the form of beans, cheese, eggs, and less often, meat. The typical diet in a Volunteer community relies heavily on corn tortillas, rice, beans, and cheese. Although fruits and vegetables are readily available, they are not commonly consumed, so anything outside of the common diet would have to be taken care of by the Volunteer. Volunteers have reported that if an individual is willing to cook, it's easier to maintain a balanced vegetarian diet.\n\n\n\nCommunication: All PCVs have the option to participate in a family cell phone plan, which allows participants the option to make unlimited free calls to other members of the plan (including Peace Corps staff). The plan also includes an inexpensive phone, and the cost of the plan (approximately $20 per month) is deducted from the PCV's monthly living allowance. There are some sites where cell phone covera, e may not be as readily available. Invitees may bring an unlocked GSM cell phone with them to use in El Salvador; however, as noted above coverage may vary.\n\n\n\nSafety & Security: Travel by PCVs to the capital is highly restricted, and currently PCVs must use the Peace Corps shuttle system for most travel outside of their immediate area.",

Post requires PCVs to follow policies. It can be difficult for PCVs who are accustomed to the freedoms and lifestyle of college to abide by established rules and adapt to changing policies. Applicants who understand what it’s like to have a supervisor and who have functioned as part of a larger company or organization generally have a greater understanding of the need for formal policies and procedures and an appreciation for the need for occasional changes in policies, making them more likely to adapt to directives of overseas staff in a flexible, mature and responsible manner. Furthermore, such applicants are more likely to demonstrate professionalism, an essential aspect of a successful service. Additional desired criteria: Overseas experience: Prefers that assignments not be an applicant’s first overseas experience, especially if the applicant is a recent college graduate. All qualified applicants should have at least 12 consecutive weeks of living experience abroad. *2 years of work or volunteer experience: despite the fact that the majority of applicants are recent college graduates, it is preferable that invitees have at least 2 years of work or volunteer experience as follows: (1) 2 years of accumulated professional experience (20+ hours a week at any job or series of jobs) during or after college (does not need to be consecutive and can include a combination of work and volunteer experience); (2) 2 years of graduate school or successful completion of a graduate degree; (3) Some combination of 1 and 2; or (4) Current enrollment in a Master’s International program.",

Volunteers live in villages among rural farming communities and provide intesive extension services aimed at increasing farmer capacities to successfully build and manage fishponds so that they can increase production and incomes. During extension visits, PCVs teach and assist farmers in technical aspects that include site selection, pond construction, stocking, management and harvesting. PCVs seek to enhance the integration of fish farming with other agricultural activities such as conservation farming, permaculture, gardening, animal husbandry, fruit trees, and agro-forestry. Since aquaculture and integrated agricultural activities are promoted as a small farm business activity, PCVs also provide training in basic business skills such as developing business plans, record keeping, marketing and financial management. As most farmers belong to aquaculture cooperatives or associations, PCVs are also involved in strengthening the organizational capacity of such local groups through providing training in aspects such as needs assessments, action planning, organizational structure, leadership and management.",

Following the first three months at site, PCVs may choose to stay with their host family, or to identify a separate housing option.  This may be a room in another family’s home, a connected apartment, or a separate apartment.  However, in many remote sites there is often a scarcity of independent housing options, and therefore most PCVs in Georgia live with a host family throughout their service. PCVs are likely to experience less privacy than what they are accustomed to in the U.S.A. Host families may expect PCVs to assist with household chores, such as, dishes, cleaning, and laundry. <br><br>Isolated Sites: As Georgia continues to develop, Peace Corps will continue to seek out more underserved, remote, and rural disadvantaged communities, which are usually more in need of Peace Corps’ assistance, and are generally poorer and have more limited access to resources. Those communities usually tend to be more isolated, and as a result volunteers should be prepared for a possible placement in such a site.",

In these organizations, the volunteer's role will be to develop the capacity of the staff working within these institutions, as well as to promote capacity building among their small business clients. Business Development Volunteers may also be assigned to regional development agencies, local branches of development or civil society organizations, humanitarian groups or schools, all of which will offer opportunities for locally-based capacity building in the area of business development. Business development Volunteers might target youth and work to increase their capacities in starting up businesses, developing their entrepreneurial skills, etc. \n\n\n\nDepending on the specific placement, the volunteer's role may be to work in partnership with the key actors in the community, to build the capacity of local institutions, or to increase the involvement of citizens and youth in local decision-making. The volunteer may facilitate collaborative activities between local non-governmental organizations, businesses, and citizen groups. He/she may provide assistance to all sectors of the community in strategic planning or in project design and management. He/she may also support the development of non-governmental organizations, and youth groups, depending on locally-identified needs.",

We can, however, accept a CED 145 married to a YD 145.  <br><br>Couples should be prepared to be flexible, as finding the right site for two people is always more challenging.  Please note that couples will live in home stay together for a period of 6.5 months; 11 weeks during PST and the first 4 months at site.  During PST one spouse may end up ‘commuting’ further to the training school than the other, due to cluster locations.   Couples should expect to have inadequate privacy during home stay periods. At the same time they will likely have an easier time integrating into the community and will be welcomed by the families.",

Educational activities include: basic business skills via a Junior Achievement-type curriculum, employability skills, utilizing information technology, etc. Depending on their Spanish level, these Volunteers may be assigned to work with a government, non-government, or community group to provide technical assistance and business training to their clients, and/or strengthen their Partner’s ability to render better services to their clients.

Volunteers should be aware that these entities are much less sophisticated than US organizations; while there are exceptions, many Nicaraguan organizations may lack the financial and material resources to respond to micro and small business owners’ needs, have very short-term planning horizons, if any strategic planning exists, and may be dependent upon a limited leadership base. Therefore, Volunteers must have initiative and demonstrated competence to work in such unstructured and unpredictable environments. Volunteers are assigned to co-teach an entrepreneurship education course in public high schools in coordination with the Ministry of Education (MINED). A vital part of this assignment is training the entrepreneurship teachers in the course material. This is to ensure that the impact we make does not only reach the current students that you will be working with, but also the generations to come. Peace Corps Nicaragua also collaborates with other NGOs and community groups to reach the high number of out-of school youth. Recognizing that small businesses form an integral part of the nation’s economy and in light of globalization and various trade agreements, the Small Business Development Project will continue helping interested micro/small business owners and entrepreneurs to improve productivity and competitiveness. We do this by motivating, inspiring, and assisting them in the development of their business plans as well as the application of sound business planning and management techniques. The project will provide current and prospective small business owners and entrepreneurs with the knowledge and skills needed to take advantage of economic opportunities, secure employment, and/or generate income.

All Volunteers in this program must be willing to teach youth entrepreneurial and life skills in high school classrooms at least half time M-F, plus weekly planning, monitoring, and evaluating progress in close coordination with Nicaraguan teachers.  Educational activities include: basic business skills via a Junior Achievement-type curriculum, employability skills, utilizing information technology, etc.\n\n\n\nDepending on their Spanish level, these Volunteers may be assigned to work with a government, non government, or community group to provide technical assistance  and business training to their clients, and/or strengthen their Partner’s ability to render better services to their clients. Post prefers that these individuals have demonstrated skills and/or non-formal education experience. Work experience designing and delivering trainings on business development and planning themes, as well as organizational development skills are strongly preferred.

Therefore, Volunteers must have initiative and demonstrated competence to work in such unstructured and unpredictable environments.\n\n\n\nVolunteers are assigned to co-teach an entrepreneurship education course in public high schools in coordination with the Ministry of Education (MINED).  A vital part of this assignment is training the entrepreneurship teachers in the course material. This is to ensure that the impact we make does not only reach the current students that you will be working with, but also the generations to come. Peace Corps Nicaragua also collaborates with other NGOs and community groups to reach the high number of out-of school youth.\n\n\n\nRecognizing that small businesses form an integral part of the nation’s economy and in light of globalization and various trade agreements, the Small Business Development Project will continue helping   interested micro/small business owners and entrepreneurs to improve productivity and competitiveness. We do this by motivating, inspiring, and assisting them in the development of their business plans as well as the application of sound business planning and management techniques. The project will provide current and prospective small business owners and entrepreneurs with the knowledge and skills needed to take advantage of economic opportunities, secure employment, and/or generate income.\n\n\n\nThe focus of the Volunteer’s work will be transmitting knowledge and developing the abilities and skills of business people, and community groups wishing to improve their quality of life through the promotion of sustainable economic activities.  \n\n\n\nA cross-cutting element the project hopes to boost between the two components is the establishment of strong linkages between the public, private, and university sectors in the community to provide opportunities for youth such as mentoring, internships, job placement, and scholarship opportunities.  Volunteers will be encouraged to work with their community to organize a career and/or college fair in their sites to increase opportunity awareness amongst the youth in the area.",

  "living_conditions_comments_condition_comments" : "Site Placements: Candidates should be aware that all site placements are in rural areas, which means that their access to many resources will be limited. All COED Volunteers have access to regular public transportation (for travel within their department), but the frequency of public transportation can vary greatly (from buses every 30 minutes to buses only on certain days of the week). Access to internet and other information resources may be limited, and given the rural placements, many Volunteers use latrines instead of indoor bathrooms.\n\n\n\nMinorities: El Salvador may be challenging for minorities because initially they are generally not viewed as Americans. This can be especially true for African-American and Asian-American PCVs.\n\n\n\nTerrain: Candidates should be aware that El Salvador is a mountainous country and site placements are in rural areas, which means there may be uneven terrain. \n\n\n\nClimate: Traditionally, El Salvador has had a tropical climate with well defined wet and dry seasons. The wet season (invierno) lasts approximately from May to October with heavy afternoon thunderstorms, and the dry season (verano) lasts from November to April, with high winds common November through January. Temperatures generally depend on altitude. In the hotter lowlands,  high temperatures can reach well into the mid- to high 30s °C (over 95 °F). On the central plateau, highs can be above 30 °C (over 85 °F) and lows may occasionally dip below 10 °C (under 50 °F). In the highlands, temperatures generally range from 12 to 23 °C (approximately 54 to 73 °F) but lows can drop below freezing.\n\n\n\nHome-stay: All Volunteers are required to live with a family during Pre-Service Training and for the duration of their service.\n\n\n\nDiet: While it is very possible to be vegetarian and/or vegan in El Salvador, it can be a challenge, and individuals will need to think through their personal strategies to maintain their diet. (This also applies to Volunteers with other special dietary considerations.) In general, protein is consumed in the form of beans, cheese, eggs, and less often, meat. The typical diet in a Volunteer community relies heavily on corn tortillas, rice, beans, and cheese. Although fruits and vegetables are readily available, they are not commonly consumed, so anything outside of the common diet would have to be taken care of by the Volunteer. Volunteers have reported that if an individual is willing to cook, it's easier to maintain a balanced vegetarian diet.\n\n\n\nCommunication: All PCVs have the option to participate in a family cell phone plan, which allows participants the option to make unlimited free calls to other members of the plan (including Peace Corps staff). The plan also includes an inexpensive phone, and the cost of the plan (approximately $20 per month) is deducted from the PCV's monthly living allowance. There are some sites where cell phone covera, e may not be as readily available. Invitees may bring an unlocked GSM cell phone with them to use in El Salvador; however, as noted above coverage may vary.\n\n\n\nSafety & Security: Travel by PCVs to the capital is highly restricted, and currently PCVs must use the Peace Corps shuttle system for most travel outside of their immediate area.",

The requirement is implemented for both security and cultural integration reasons. \n\n\n\nNote: PC/El Salvador requires PCVs to follow policies for specific reasons. Often it can be difficult for PCVs who are accustomed to the freedoms and lifestyle of college to abide by established rules and adapt to changing policies. Applicants who understand what it’s like to have a supervisor and who have functioned as part of a larger company or organization generally have a greater understanding of the need for formal policies and procedures and an appreciation for the need for occasional changes in policies, making them more likely to adapt to directives of overseas staff in a flexible, mature and responsible manner. Furthermore, such applicants are more likely to demonstrate professionalism, an essential aspect of a successful service. \n\n\n\nADDITIONAL DESIRED CRITERIA FOR SERVICE IN PC/El Salvador: \n\n• Overseas experience: PC/El Salvador prefers that assignments in El Salvador not be an applicant’s first overseas experience, especially if the applicant is a recent college graduate.

In addition, a number of international human rights groups have expressed concern with the rise in “skinhead” activity in Ukraine, and with the increasing number of attacks and fatalities targeting individuals of African, Asian, Hispanic, or Middle Eastern heritage. Most hate crimes in Ukraine have centered on males, and occur principally in larger cities. However, the vast majority of Minority Volunteers serve successfully without any particular difficulties and by doing so provide a positive opportunity to demonstrate American diversity to Ukrainians.",

During the winter months PCVs should be prepared to keep themselves warm and protected from sometimes difficult weather conditions such as high amounts of snowfall and intense cold.\n\n\n\nMay be challenging for Minorities: Volunteers from any minority group may be the only minority trainees or Volunteers within a particular program, and as a result may face additional unwanted attention. They may work and live with individuals with no experience with, or understanding of, their culture. They may not receive the necessary personal support from other Volunteers or find minority role models within Peace Corps country staff. In general, host families and counterparts are very accepting of diversity among Volunteers, and close relationships are forged without any regard to ethnicity. \n\n\n\nLiving with Host Families: PCVs, including couples, will live with host families throughout their training, and for at least the first 3 months once at their permanent sites. Following the first three months at site, PCVs may choose to stay with their host family, or to identify a separate housing option. This may be a room in another family’s home, a connected apartment, or a separate apartment. However, in many remote sites there is often a scarcity of independent housing options, and therefore most PCVs in Georgia live with a host family throughout their service. PCVs are likely to experience less privacy than what they are accustomed to in the U.S.A. Host families may expect PCVs to assist with household chores, such as, dishes, cleaning, and laundry. \n\n\n\nIsolated Sites: As Georgia continues to develop, Peace Corps will continue to seek out more underserved, remote, and rural disadvantaged communities, which are usually more in need of Peace Corps’ assistance, and are generally poorer and have more limited access to resources. Those communities usually tend to be more isolated, and as a result volunteers should be prepared for a possible placement in such a site.",

  "living_conditions_comments_condition_comments" : "Water & Bathrooms:  Volunteers assigned to villages may live in houses with outdoor squat-style pit latrines and may or may not have indoor plumbing for bathing.  Regardless of water availability inside homes, most rural-based volunteers will bathe using bucket baths.  Volunteers in towns or cities will most likely live in Soviet-era apartment buildings that have not been well maintained cosmetically over the past 30+ years.  They are structurally sound, have electricity, but may lack 24 hr water supply. Bathrooms may or may not have a working shower; in the later case, Volunteers will bathe using bucket baths.Winter Heating:  Heating varies from wood or dung burning stoves in rural villages to natural gas heating stoves or central hot water radiated heating systems.  Peace Corps provides all volunteers with electric oil radiant heaters to supplement the existing heating system.<br><br>Electricity:  All households for PCT/Vs in Armenia have electricity from the central grid on a 220-240 volt, 50 Hz system for both large and small appliances.  110 v 50 Hz step-down power transformers are readily available on the local market, however all modern cell phone & computer power adapters have a 110-240 v 50-60 Hz range so the transformer is not needed.  Plug adapters (flat 2-3 prong to 2-pin) are readily available on the local market.<br><br>Working Conditions:  This varies considerably from urban to village sites and village to village sites.  Some facilities (schools, municipal buildings, offices, etc.) have been newly renovated while many have not.  As such, expect dilapidated structures with poor to no heating in winter; outside pit latrines on village school grounds is common.<br><br>Roads & Public Transportation:  In general, the roads are in fair to poor condition; however public transportation and taxi services are fairly reliable.  Previously asphalted rural/village roads are mostly deteriorated to dirt roads with potholes and can get very muddy during the rains.  In small villages, transportation to and from job site is by foot (bring a clean pair of shoes to change into at work), while in larger villages and towns there is public transportation via mini busses.  Transportation between villages and towns is by minibus or taxi.<br><br>Telecommunications:  This service is well developed throughout the country with digital fiber optic transmission lines and three cell phone operators with nearly country-wide coverage.  All cell phone providers have 3G networks that cover over half of the country, and they provide Internet service through USB modems supporting HSPA/UMTS/EDGE/GPRS technology.  This area is changing rapidly and providers are upgrading systems and technology annually.  If Trainees want to bring a cell phone, it should be unlocked; rechargeable SIM cards are available at the many branch offices throughout the country.  Unlocked USB modems will also work with the current providers.<br><br>Climate: Armenia has a highland continental climate that enjoys four seasons with short wet springs, dry hot summers, short mild autumns, and very cold winters.  It has various microclimates due to the range of elevations so expect variation from place to place and season to season.  Come prepared with warm clothing and boots for the winter months.<br><br>Armenians are generally fastidious about their appearance and dress neatly even in villages. Men keep short hair and are clean shaven. The few who do have beards or mustaches tend to be over 40 years of age and generally keep them trim and neat. Women generally wear fashionable clothes and makeup. In the workplace, be it a school, NGO or other institution, PCT/Vs are expected to dress at minimum “business casual” – for men this mean collared shirts, slacks and sport coat, and for women dresses, dress suits, slacks, sweaters, collared shirts, etc. Torn and/or dirty jeans, t-shirts, tank tops, and other casual clothes are not acceptable in the workplace and most social situations.",

For nearly two decades, Peace Corps had projects in small business and community development, and in 2012 turned its focus to community and youth development based on a review of country needs and changing priorities aimed at youth. As such, Peace Corps’s Community and Youth Development project (CYD) places Volunteers in communities throughout Armenia to work towards the accomplishment of two goals:<br><br>Goal 1: Increase the internal capacity and professionalism of organizations<br>Volunteers provide human and institutional capacity development assistance for Armenian organizations to improve their internal governance practices, professionalize outward-focused activities such as marketing and public relations, better assess community issues and develop strategies for their resolution, and utilize local assets and resources to progress toward financial sustainability. Volunteers may find themselves helping an organization improve its human resource management practices by assisting in writing job descriptions and implementing professional development plans for the staff. As well, they assist organizations to improve their planning, implementation, and monitoring & evaluation of community projects.<br><br>Goal 2: Implement programs that lead to positive youth development<br>Through various programs, clubs, and workshops for youth, Peace Corps Volunteers aim to transfer valuable personal and professional skills to Armenia’s youth in order to enhance their capacity as leaders in their communities, promote service-based learning, and assist with career skills development. Volunteers may organize entrepreneurship camps for youth that focus on small-business skills and business plan preparation. They might create after-school activities that teach leadership skills to youth through civic engagement and community development projects.

During the winter months PCVs should be prepared to keep themselves warm and protected from sometimes difficult weather conditions such as high amounts of snowfall and intense cold.\n\n\n\nMay be challenging for Minorities: Volunteers from any minority group may be the only minority trainees or Volunteers within a particular program, and as a result may face additional unwanted attention. They may work and live with individuals with no experience with, or understanding of, their culture. They may not receive the necessary personal support from other Volunteers or find minority role models within Peace Corps country staff.  In general, host families and counterparts are very accepting of diversity among Volunteers, and close relationships are forged without any regard to ethnicity. \n\n\n\nLiving with Host Families: PCVs, including couples, will live with host families throughout their training, and for at least the first 3 months once at their permanent sites.  Following the first three months at site, PCVs may choose to stay with their host family, or to identify a separate housing option.  This may be a room in another family’s home, a connected apartment, or a separate apartment.  However, in many remote sites there is often a scarcity of independent housing options, and therefore most PCVs in Georgia live with a host family throughout their service. PCVs are likely to experience less privacy than what they are accustomed to in the U.S.A. Host families may expect PCVs to assist with household chores, such as, dishes, cleaning, and laundry. \n\n\n\nIsolated Sites: As Georgia continues to develop, Peace Corps will continue to seek out more underserved, remote, and rural disadvantaged communities, which are usually more in need of Peace Corps’ assistance, and are generally poorer and have more limited access to resources. Those communities usually tend to be more isolated, and as a result volunteers should be prepared for a possible placement in such a site.",

Emphasis will be placed on smaller towns and more rural areas, and no Volunteers will be placed in the capital city of Tirana.\n\n   \n\nVolunteers will work closely with health education professionals, nurses, and other health professionals, as well as with teachers in schools and kindergartens to increase their capacities regarding new techniques and methods of teaching and promoting preventive health education. Volunteers will also link with NGOs and other community-based organizations to provide basic health education, promote good sanitation and hygiene practices, and raise awareness about HIV/AIDS and other emerging health issues. Using a “life skills” approach is considered to be a very important element for your every day work in the community. In a given week, you may find yourself working at schools, local clinics, youth service centers or community groups providing education and building awareness on health issues such as drug abuse, maternal and child health, breast cancer, personal hygiene, water quality, and other local health problems. Volunteer activities will involve developing health campaigns, working on the development of informational and instructional materials, and training Albanian health practitioners on how to use them, or delivering the campaigns to school children and community members yourself.  \n\n\n\nAlthough Volunteers will be assigned to an office of the district health promotion unit, work will also be outside the office – in the community – and Volunteers will likely have more than one main colleague, depending on the project or activity you are involved in at the time.  Volunteers may work with an inspector for hygiene or maternal child health, with schoolteachers responsible for health education classes, with representatives of NGOs, as well as with your colleagues at a District Health Promotion Unit. If placed with a rural health center, the volunteer's work will be more focused on linking directly with the doctors and nurses staffing those facilities and the smaller health posts in the surrounding villages, as well as schools and kindergartens linking them with resources and assistance to improve their skills and implementation of health education efforts. Finding colleagues to work with on diverse projects will not be automatic but will demand a concerted effort on the Volunteer’s part to seek out active community members. For this reason, successful community integration is crucial.",

RFHP will specifically focus on education and prevention activities on Maternal & Child Heath, and Non-Communicable Diseases.  The project will work directly with the Belize Ministry of Health (MOH) through the Health Education and Community Participation Bureau (HECOPAB), the MCH and the Epidemiology units. As the health promotion arm of the Ministry of Health, HECOPAB will co-lead the planning, coordination and implementation of health promotion, education and training activities of the RFCH project in partnership with Peace Corps Belize.  This project will have a five year implementation phase. The project will support the empowerment of Belizean citizens to assume responsibility for their health and well-being through increased access to health information through the utilization of the mass media, skills development through training for community health workers, and the promotion of the primary health care principles and concepts. The project will also emphasize behavior change and individual empowerment through carefully designed activities that focus on increasing positive changes in everyday lives. AA 154 – Health Resource Volunteer Community Health Resource Volunteers may find themselves working directly with community health workers (CHW) and other health leaders, in remote villages throughout Belize. A CHW is a dedicated community member that may or may not be a skilled health professional but that possesses basic health training. Health Resource Volunteers will find themselves working in village based health centers and clinics alongside community health workers, district health educators, health professionals, and hospital and polyclinic administrators, planning workshops, technical seminars, and providing key support to community health workers in these villages. Health Resource Volunteers must be willing to live in areas under physical hardship if required, and must be committed and have a demonstrated interested in community health.

  "project_description_project_description" : "The project is being implemented  through the recruitment, organization, management and technical assistance of a network of 200 Escojo Groups and 100 Healthy Homes Sub-Committees.  One major strength of the Healthy Communities Project is that generalist Volunteers, with proper training,  can  effectively perform the interventions designed to assist community-based organizations achieve project objectives.  PCDR is successfully developing the capacity of generalist Volunteers through targeted PST, IST and technical trainings.  A significant proportion of Healthy Community Volunteers reported in the AVS that what they learned in their PST training helps them provide quality information that helps clients make informed decision concerning health and lifestyle decisions. This project is scheduled to continue its annual Volunteer force of 30 (to 40) in the coming years. For FY11/12, it is expected that 15,200 youth and 9,500 children and women will benefit from this assistance. Also, one of  Peace Corps DR’s  primary Health  sector objectives  is to assist public and private efforts to improve  the health  environment  of low income  families.   Since impure water and a lack of sanitation causes and/or contributes to a number of debilitating diseases that include: cholera, endemic diarrhea, dengue etc, the continuation of Peace Corps’  water and sanitation activities are critical  for program success.  With guidance from the Health/APCD and the DPT, and the Water and Sanitation Specialist will manage the carryover Volunteers from the defunct AT project and cross-sectoral secondary water/latrine project activities. The Specialist will actively engage in assisting community Water and Latrine Committees and Volunteers in activities that are designed to ensure adequate resources for the construction of water systems. Healthy Communities Project Summary. The purpose of the Healthy Communities Project (HC) is to improve individual and family health of low-income Dominicans living in rural and marginal urban communities through the adoption of healthy decisions and practices. This purpose is consistent with on-going national plans of the private and public sector to reduce maternal/child and youth mortality in low-income families living in rural and marginal urban villages. This purpose is being accomplished through the organization and training of a network of 286 youth groups (Escojo)for the promotion of healthy decisions (HIV prevention in youth and prevention of early pregnancy in adolescents) and 120 mothers groups (Healthy Homes) for the promotion of healthy practices at the family level. Annually, every youth groups has the capacity of orienting an average of 100 youth (Student and nonstudents) and every mothers group have the capacity of certifying 30 families as Healthy Families through home visits. These numbers might reduce if we re-enforce the  new framework in these groups.",

Many Volunteers will be expected to collaborate with both MINSA and NGOs working in a particular municipality of Nicaragua. As a Volunteer you will be involved in training MINSA staff, volunteer community health workers (brigadistas), NGO staff members, local schools, youth groups, most-at-risk population (MARP) and other community members. Your role in this capacity is a threefold: a) direct education to community members (such as mothers' groups, adolescent groups, men groups, and schoolchildren) including Most –at-Risk Populations about preventative health practices. b) training of service providers such as peer educators, volunteer community health workers, empirical midwives and school teachers, in non-formal education techniques directed towards the reduction of unwanted pregnancies, healthy sexual practices, and improved maternal and infant health. c) facilitate and organize health groups to assist your role in the training (for example, health advisory committees, communty health assessment teams,  women's groups, mothers' groups, community-based maternal homes, and adolescent groups).The purpose of our program is for Nicaraguans to adopt healthy behaviors to improve their overall health situation, and the project has three main goals: 1. Community members will adopt healthy behaviors and practices to decrease the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. <br>As a volunteer you will be training the general population, Most at risk population, and service providers on HIV and STIs information, transmission, prevention, testing, and reduction of stigma and discrimination, through non formal education techniques, to promote awareness and reduce negative judgement towards those living with HIV, while improving the provision of pre and post test counseling services.  2. Youth will adopt healthy behaviors and practices to reduce the number of teenage pregnancies. As a Volunteer you will be working with youth in general and with Peer educators in more depth to conduct behavior change Interventions on Sexual and Reproductive Health using non-formal education techniques. So for instance as a volunteer you would help organize and facilitate teen groups to help them develop the life planning skills such as:  communication, gender, values clarification, decision-making, self-esteem, reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, STIs and drug and alcohol abuse; necessary to promote healthy adolescent behavior. 3. Community members will adopt behaviors and practices that contribute to improved maternal and infant health outcomes. As a volunteer your role would be training service providers as well as community members, more specifically mothers in topics such as signs & symptoms indicating the need to seek immediate care during pregnancy, labor as well as care for the newborn, exclusive breastfeeding & best feeding practices as well as contraceptive methods, with non formal education techiques, in different settings such as: health centers and posts, casas maternas, women’s organizations or groups.<br><br>Upon arrival at your project site, you will conduct a health survey (CASA: Community And Sector Assessment) directed at evaluating the health problems that you will address during your two years of service.  The community and your project partner(s) will assist you with this survey to identify issues such as disease patterns, knowledge, attitudes, and general priorities. The preventative health activities that you develop and implement will be primarily focused on changes in knowledge and changes in behaviors.",

Your primary focus is the formation and training of youth programs to promote healthy sexual practices, providing creative non-formal health communication, strengthening the capacities of local health institutions, organizaing and training womens' groups to decrease the high rates of maternal and child morbidity and mortaltiy, and generally promoting good health with the community. Your role in this capacity is threefold: \n\n\n\n1) direct education to community members (such as mothers' groups, adolescent groups, men groups, and schoolchildren) about preventative health practices \n\n2) facilitate and organize health groups to assist your role in the training of health promoters (for example, health advisory committees, communty health assessment teams,  women's groups, mothers' groups, community-based maternal homes, and adolescent groups)\n\n3) training of youth, volunteer community health promoters, and midwives in non-formal education techniques directed towards the reduction of unwanted pregnancies, healthy sexual practices, and improved maternal and child health.  \n\n\n\nSome examples of the activities that Volunteers conduct in the field are the following:\n\n\n\n• Healthy Sexual Behaviors in Adolescent and Adult Populations. \n\nVolunteers work mainly with youth and vulnerable populations in basic prevention activities. These activities might include promoting the \"ABCs\" with youth groups to stress the importance of: A: abstinence, B: being faithful, and C: correct condom use. A few Volunteers work with other agencies on HIV community mobilization projects such as parades and health fairs to decrease stigmatization and generally promote awareness. Other activities might include promoting testing with vulnerable populations, training MINSA staff to reduce discrimination towards those living with HIV/AIDS, or improving the provision of pre and post test counseling services.  \n\n\n\n• Reduction of Undesired Pregnancies in Adolescents and Women. Volunteers help organize and facilitate teen groups to help them develop the life planning skills necessary to avoid unhealthy adolescent behavior.  (Life planning skills include: communication skills, gender, values clarification, decision-making, self-esteem, reproductive health, HIV/AIDS and drug and alcohol abuse.)\n\n\n\n• Contribute Towards Reducing the Rates of Maternal and Child Mortality and Morbidity. Volunteers work with men, women, boys and girls to address family health concerns. These may include: organizing and facilitating women's groups (including pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers) to improve women's physical and mental health; teaching about recognizing warning signs in pregnancy and in children, domestic violence, gender, parenting skills, men's health topics, etc. Volunteers promote the benefits of healthy eating habits in order to decrease malnutrition.

One major strength of the Healthy Communities Project is that generalist Volunteers, with proper training, can effectively perform the interventions designed to assist community-based organizations achieve project objectives. PCDR is successfully developing the capacity of generalist Volunteers through targeted PST, IST and technical trainings. A significant proportion of Healthy Community Volunteers reported in the AVS that what they learned in their PST training helps them provide quality information that helps clients make informed decision concerning health and lifestyle decisions. This project is scheduled to continue its annual Volunteer force of 30 (to 40) in the coming years. For FY11/12, it is expected that 15,200 youth and 9,500 children and women will benefit from this assistance. Also, one of Peace Corps DR’s primary Health sector objectives is to assist public and private efforts to improve the health environment of low income families. Since impure water and a lack of sanitation causes and/or contributes to a number of debilitating diseases that include: cholera, endemic diarrhea, dengue etc, the continuation of Peace Corps’ water and sanitation activities are critical for program success. With guidance from the Health/APCD and the DPT, and the Water and Sanitation Specialist will manage the carryover Volunteers from the defunct AT project and cross-sectoral secondary water/latrine project activities. The Specialist will actively engage in assisting community Water and Latrine Committees and Volunteers in activities that are designed to ensure adequate resources for the construction of water systems. Healthy Communities Project Summary. The purpose of the Healthy Communities Project (HC) is to improve individual and family health of low-income Dominicans living in rural and marginal urban communities through the adoption of healthy decisions and practices. This purpose is consistent with on-going national plans of the private and public sector to reduce maternal/child and youth mortality in low-income families living in rural and marginal urban villages. This purpose is being accomplished through the organization and training of a network of 286 youth groups (Escojo)for the promotion of healthy decisions (HIV prevention in youth and prevention of early pregnancy in adolescents) and 120 mothers groups (Healthy Homes) for the promotion of healthy practices at the family level. Annually, every youth groups has the capacity of orienting an average of 100 youth (Student and nonstudents) and every mothers group have the capacity of certifying 30 families as Healthy Families through home visits. These numbers might reduce if we re-enforce the new framework in these groups.",

Volunteer activities directly support the Ministry of Public Health’s priority areas in health education, including: malaria, diarrhea disease, respiratory infections, malnutrition, vaccination in children under five and pregnant women, and reproductive health (including STIs and HIV/AIDS).  Volunteers and their Counterparts effectively prepare and deliver preventive health interventions to men, women and youth in communities using various techniques, including: health education sessions, community outreach, care group creation, community health agent training, behavior change concepts and Life Skills activities.  The Public Health project has been well-received in Guinea and stakeholders express strong interest in its continued success.

RFHP will specifically focus on education and prevention activities on Maternal & Child Heath, and Non-Communicable Diseases.  The project will work directly with the Belize Ministry of Health (MOH) through the Health Education and Community Participation Bureau (HECOPAB), the MCH and the Epidemiology units. As the health promotion arm of the Ministry of Health, HECOPAB will co-lead the planning, coordination and implementation of health promotion, education and training activities of the RFCH project in partnership with Peace Corps Belize.  This project will have a five year implementation phase. The project will support the empowerment of Belizean citizens to assume responsibility for their health and well-being through increased access to health information through the utilization of the mass media, skills development through training for community health workers, and the promotion of the primary health care principles and concepts. The project will also emphasize behavior change and individual empowerment through carefully designed activities that focus on increasing positive changes in everyday lives. <br><br>Community Health Resource Volunteers may find themselves working directly with community health workers (CHW) and other health leaders, in remote villages throughout Belize. A CHW is a dedicated community member that may or may not be a skilled health professional but that possesses basic health training. Health Resource Volunteers will find themselves working in village based health centers and clinics alongside community health workers, district health educators, health professionals, and hospital and polyclinic administrators, planning workshops, technical seminars, and providing key support to community health workers in these villages. Health Resource Volunteers must be willing to live in areas under physical hardship if required, and must be committed and have a demonstrated interested in community health. They may also find themselves assessing health needs and designing public health activities in partnership with the Ministry of Health’s Education and Community Participation Bureau (HECOPAB). Post anticipates that a Health Resource Volunteer will balance their time delivering technical assistance and providing systems strengthening support at the regional level. <br> <br>Specifically an AA 155 may engage in the following activities: <br><br>- Assist HECOPAB and the Maternal and Child Health Unit implement key health education and promotion activities designed to help families adopt positive behaviors and practices that contribute to the health of pregnant women and children.<br>- Promote the prevention of childhood illnesses by improving the quality of health information about child care and immunizations to reduce child mortality in rural communities.<br>- Assist HECOPAB and the Maternal and Child Health Unit design activities to improve infant and young child nutrition through health education and promotion.<br>- Assist HECOPAB in utilizing the newly redesigned community health workers manual aimed to promote healthy lifestyles, improved nutrition, reduce the incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCD), and to discourage sedentary lifestyles. <br>- Promote physical activities with community members in order to foster physical and mental wellbeing and social connectedness in rural communities.<br>- Promote healthy eating practices with community members and rural community health workers in small communities to prevent the onset of NCDs.<br>- Ensure the designed activities take into consideration each community’s health profile.  <br>- Lead Volunteer Task Teams to address MOH NCD and MCH priorities. <br>- May be involved in HIV/AIDS education and prevention outreach activities.<br>- Promote skills training of community health workers. <br>- Serve on Volunteer Health Task teams.",

Their aim is to help the community place an emphasis on preventive health care.  Focus areas include: 1-Maternal and Child Health: Maternal Health, Nutrition, Prevention of Childhood Illnesses, and Malaria. 2- Environmental Health: Community Water Sanitation, Household, Water, Hygiene and Sanitation, Hygiene, Water and Saniatation at Schools. 3-capacity Building for Community Workers: IEC/BCC and Management. \n\n\n\nPCVs will work with individuals (Health care counterparts, CHWs, Community Leaders,Community groups, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)  with the goal to support global and national efforts to ensure that all Malagasy have long and healthy lives through: mobilizing community members, trainings, workshops, one-on-one mentoring, health promotion activities, BCC/IEC, Outreach, and other related capacity building activities. \n\nAs a Community Health Advisor, you will work at the community level with local counterparts.  Peace Corps will post you with a rural health clinic run by the MOH.  You will help train village level health educators in your target area.  You and your counterpart will work on implementing a social communication process to improve Madagascar's health workers' ability to transfer important messages to mothers and caregivers. \n\n\n\nYou will work with Community Health Supervisor to assist communities served by your health clinic and focus on health outreach interventions to those communities.  \n\n\n\nThis would include:\n\n• With Community Health Workers (CHWs), provide health education at household, community and schools level\n\n• Focus on Behavior Change through the use of evidence-based methodologies (e.g. Care Group model)\n\n• Assist CHWs with quality of their HE education: technique, visual aids, etc.\n\n• Train CHWs in Behavior Change Communication strategies and techniques\n\n• Identify concrete interventions at household and community levels in areas of Maternal, and Child Health including: \n\n- Promoting Safe pregnancies \n\n- Promote better Nutrition for Mothers and Child\n\n- Prevention of childhood Illnesses\n\n- Malaria Prevention and Control\n\n- \n\n\n\n• Identify concrete interventions at household and community levels in the areas of Environmental Health.\n\n- Community Water and Sanitation\n\n- Household Water, Hygiene and Sanitation\n\n- Water, Hygiene and Sanitation at schools\n\n\n\n• Capacity Building for CHWs in their Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation (MRE) requirements\n\n- Support for IEC/BCC Intervetions\n\n- Promotion of better Management skills\n\nDissemination of health messages is often most effective in one-on-one discussion or when they take place in venues such as village forums, theaters, and festivals, or during informal social communication.   \n\n\n\nYou will organize formal training sessions on health information, education, and interventions for your counterparts, village health educators, peer educators, and teachers.  Transferring skills in order to effectively conduct health education at the village level is the key to ensuring your efforts will be sustainable after the Peace Corps project ends.\n\n\n\nYou will have a lot of opportunity for creative input.  You will need to be self-directed and able to motivate others.  You will need the ability to conceptualize, organize, and present ideas clearly in verbal and written form.  Strong local Malagasy language skills will also be necessary since you will be communicating with people from varying levels of society.\n\n\n\nPlease note that your success as a Peace Corps Volunteer in this project requires a strong and equal commitment to both the development of excellent communication skills and excellent cross-cultural skills.",

Emphasis will be placed on smaller towns and more rural areas, and no Volunteers will be placed in the capital city of Tirana.\n\n\n\nVolunteers will work closely with health education professionals, nurses, and other health professionals, as well as with teachers in schools and kindergartens to increase their capacities regarding new techniques and methods of teaching and promoting preventive health education. Volunteers will also link with NGOs and other community-based organizations to provide basic health education, promote good sanitation and hygiene practices, and raise awareness about HIV/AIDS and other emerging health issues. Using a “life skills” approach is considered to be a very important element for your every day work in the community. In a given week, you may find yourself working at schools, local clinics, youth service centers or community groups providing education and building awareness on health issues such as drug abuse, maternal and child health, breast cancer, personal hygiene, water quality, and other local health problems. Volunteer activities will involve developing health campaigns, working on the development of informational and instructional materials, and training Albanian health practitioners on how to use them, or delivering the campaigns to school children and community members yourself. \n\n\n\nAlthough Volunteers will be assigned to an office of the district health promotion unit, work will also be outside the office – in the community – and Volunteers will likely have more than one main colleague, depending on the project or activity you are involved in at the time. Volunteers may work with an inspector for hygiene or maternal child health, with schoolteachers responsible for health education classes, with representatives of NGOs, as well as with your colleagues at a District Health Promotion Unit. If placed with a rural health center, the volunteer's work will be more focused on linking directly with the doctors and nurses staffing those facilities and the smaller health posts in the surrounding villages, as well as schools and kindergartens linking them with resources and assistance to improve their skills and implementation of health education efforts. Finding colleagues to work with on diverse projects will not be automatic but will demand a concerted effort on the Volunteer’s part to seek out active community members. For this reason, successful community integration is crucial.",

Many Volunteers will be expected to collaborate with both MINSA and NGOs working in a particular municipality of Nicaragua. As a Volunteer you will be involved in training  MINSA staff , volunteer community health promoters (brigadistas), NGO staff members, local schools, youth groups, most-at-risk population of contracting HIV, and other community members.  Your primary focus is the formation and training of youth programs to promote healthy sexual practices, providing creative non-formal health communication, strengthening the capacities of local health institutions, organizaing and training womens' groups to decrease the high rates of maternal and child morbidity and mortaltiy, and generally promoting good health with the community. Your role in this capacity is threefold: <br><br>1) direct education to community members (such as mothers' groups, adolescent groups, men groups, and schoolchildren) about preventative health practices <br>2) facilitate and organize health groups to assist your role in the training of health promoters (for example, health advisory committees, communty health assessment teams,  women's groups, mothers' groups, community-based maternal homes, and adolescent groups)<br>3) training of youth, volunteer community health promoters, and midwives in non-formal education techniques directed towards the reduction of unwanted pregnancies, healthy sexual practices, and improved maternal and child health.  <br><br>Some examples of the activities that Volunteers conduct in the field are the following:<br><br>• Healthy Sexual Behaviors in Adolescent and Adult Populations. <br>Volunteers work mainly with youth and vulnerable populations in basic prevention activities. These activities might include promoting the \"ABCs\" with youth groups to stress the importance of: A: abstinence, B: being faithful, and C: correct condom use. A few Volunteers work with other agencies on HIV community mobilization projects such as parades and health fairs to decrease stigmatization and generally promote awareness. Other activities might include promoting testing with vulnerable populations, training MINSA staff to reduce discrimination towards those living with HIV/AIDS, or improving the provision of pre and post test counseling services.  <br><br>• Reduction of Undesired Pregnancies in Adolescents and Women. Volunteers help organize and facilitate teen groups to help them develop the life planning skills necessary to avoid unhealthy adolescent behavior.  (Life planning skills include: communication skills, gender, values clarification, decision-making, self-esteem, reproductive health, HIV/AIDS and drug and alcohol abuse.)<br><br>• Contribute Towards Reducing the Rates of Maternal and Child Mortality and Morbidity. Volunteers work with men, women, boys and girls to address family health concerns. These may include: organizing and facilitating women's groups (including pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers) to improve women's physical and mental health; teaching about recognizing warning signs in pregnancy and in children, domestic violence, gender, parenting skills, men's health topics, etc. Volunteers promote the benefits of healthy eating habits in order to decrease malnutrition. Their work includes the promotion of soy, leafy greens, and other locally available food rich in vitamins and nutrients.",

Community members will adopt healthy behaviors and practices to decrease the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. <br>As a volunteer you will be training the general population, Most at risk population, and service providers on HIV and STIs information, transmission, prevention, testing, and reduction of stigma and discrimination, through non formal education techniques, to promote awareness and reduce negative judgement towards those living with HIV, while improving the provision of pre and post test counseling services.  2. Youth will adopt healthy behaviors and practices to reduce the number of teenage pregnancies. As a Volunteer you will be working with youth in general and with Peer educators in more depth to conduct behavior change Interventions on Sexual and Reproductive Health using non-formal education techniques. So for instance as a volunteer you would help organize and facilitate teen groups to help them develop the life planning skills such as:  communication, gender, values clarification, decision-making, self-esteem, reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, STIs and drug and alcohol abuse; necessary to promote healthy adolescent behavior. 3. Community members will adopt behaviors and practices that contribute to improved maternal and infant health outcomes. As a volunteer your role would be training service providers as well as community members, more specifically mothers in topics such as signs & symptoms indicating the need to seek immediate care during pregnancy, labor as well as care for the newborn, exclusive breastfeeding & best feeding practices as well as contraceptive methods, with non formal education techiques, in different settings such as: health centers and posts, casas maternas, women’s organizations or groups.<br><br>Upon arrival at your project site, you will conduct a health survey (CASA: Community And Sector Assessment) directed at evaluating the health problems that you will address during your two years of service.

Most living conditions are fairly austere, transport is limited and medical facilities in the country are very basic.  Volunteers awill be staying with host families; they must be able to carry water containers (up to 25 lbs), for 10 minutes if necessary, and be able to walk up to 5 kilometres and cycle up to 10 kilometres. Only a few, if any placements will be in the urban area where these conditions do not apply to the same extent.Few sites have access to the internet.  A few internet cafes exist in some larger towns,, but access is slow, patchy and dependent on unreliable electricity.   There is access at the PC office, and in our two transit houses. Communications between PC staff and volunteers as well as among volunteers, is mainly by phone and text, and all trainees receive a cell phone on arrival.  This generally works very well, despite a few network issues.  As an example, in the last EAP test, almost 90% of volunteers were reached in under 4 hours.  <br><br>Many vegetarians have managed to maintain a healthy diet here.  However, as the supply and range of vegetables in the country is limited, this can present challenges and requires some flexibility. It is very difficult for volunteers to persist with a vegan diet through their service. <br><br>The Gambia is a small country. Partly as a result of that, contact between staff and volunteers is high.  PC staff pride themselves on the support they provide to volunteers, and this is well appreciated by the volunteer community.<br><br>Diversity issues - The Gambia is conservative by U.S. standards, and many Gambians disapprove of homosexuality. Because of this, gay, lesbian, and bisexual volunteers have not been able to be open about their sexual orientation. However, Peace Corps The Gambia provides an open and supportive atmosphere for gay, lesbian, and bisexual volunteers. Gambians are very welcoming and generous. However, many, especially in the rural areas, have little knowledge of the wider world. As a result, they often base their assumptions on very stereotypical images. For example, they may assume that all Asian Americans are of Chinese origin, or that African Americans should understand Gambian culture or even language. Gambian women, especially in rural areas, have very traditional roles. As a result, North American women may not be able to exercise the freedoms to which they are accustomed. This being said, most volunteers are able to adapt to local expectations, and are happily integrated into their communities.",

As a result the majority of students at the senior secondary level do not have the basic skills necessary to fully comprehend the content of most technical subjects such as Math and Science. Therefore, Post believes it is critical to begin placing Volunteers in junior high schools, grades 7 – 9, to teach the basic math skills that students will need in order to excel in Math and the Science classes at the senior secondary level.

Volunteers might teach in classrooms with a large amount of students (50-80 students). Within a given class there could be a wide range of student level/ability, requiring remedial work (before or after school tutoring sessions) and differentiated learning lesson planning. Some Volunteers might have students who are much older than their peers (possibly in their early twenties). Volunteers will often teach with limited resources, including poor school infrastructure. Many students will be well below the curriculum level, due to the fact that the school system often passes students to the next level, even when students do not have the minimum skills necessary to advance to the next grade. Volunteers might have to adapt to a system where their grades are good indicators of students progress (or lack thereof), but not a determining factor in a student’s passing. Post encourages volunteers to create secondary projects in vocational education, school or community gardens, and basic health education.

  "living_conditions_comments_condition_comments" : "Site Placements: Candidates should be aware that all site placements are in rural areas, which means that their access to many resources will be limited. All COED Volunteers have access to regular public transportation (for travel within their department), but the frequency of public transportation can vary greatly (from buses every 30 minutes to buses only on certain days of the week). Access to internet and other information resources may be limited, and given the rural placements, many Volunteers use latrines instead of indoor bathrooms.\n\n\n\nMinorities: El Salvador may be challenging for minorities because initially they are generally not viewed as Americans. This can be especially true for African-American and Asian-American PCVs.\n\n\n\nTerrain: Candidates should be aware that El Salvador is a mountainous country and site placements are in rural areas, which means there may be uneven terrain. \n\n\n\nClimate: Traditionally, El Salvador has had a tropical climate with well defined wet and dry seasons. The wet season (invierno) lasts approximately from May to October with heavy afternoon thunderstorms, and the dry season (verano) lasts from November to April, with high winds common November through January. Temperatures generally depend on altitude. In the hotter lowlands,  high temperatures can reach well into the mid- to high 30s °C (over 95 °F). On the central plateau, highs can be above 30 °C (over 85 °F) and lows may occasionally dip below 10 °C (under 50 °F). In the highlands, temperatures generally range from 12 to 23 °C (approximately 54 to 73 °F) but lows can drop below freezing.\n\n\n\nHome-stay: All Volunteers are required to live with a family during Pre-Service Training and for the duration of their service.\n\n\n\nDiet: While it is very possible to be vegetarian and/or vegan in El Salvador, it can be a challenge, and individuals will need to think through their personal strategies to maintain their diet. (This also applies to Volunteers with other special dietary considerations.) In general, protein is consumed in the form of beans, cheese, eggs, and less often, meat. The typical diet in a Volunteer community relies heavily on corn tortillas, rice, beans, and cheese. Although fruits and vegetables are readily available, they are not commonly consumed, so anything outside of the common diet would have to be taken care of by the Volunteer. Volunteers have reported that if an individual is willing to cook, it's easier to maintain a balanced vegetarian diet.\n\n\n\nCommunication: All PCVs have the option to participate in a family cell phone plan, which allows participants the option to make unlimited free calls to other members of the plan (including Peace Corps staff). The plan also includes an inexpensive phone, and the cost of the plan (approximately $20 per month) is deducted from the PCV's monthly living allowance. There are some sites where cell phone covera, e may not be as readily available. Invitees may bring an unlocked GSM cell phone with them to use in El Salvador; however, as noted above coverage may vary.\n\n\n\nSafety & Security: Travel by PCVs to the capital is highly restricted, and currently PCVs must use the Peace Corps shuttle system for most travel outside of their immediate area.",

The requirement is implemented for both security and cultural integration reasons. \n\n\n\nNote: PC/El Salvador requires PCVs to follow policies for specific reasons. Often it can be difficult for PCVs who are accustomed to the freedoms and lifestyle of college to abide by established rules and adapt to changing policies. Applicants who understand what it’s like to have a supervisor and who have functioned as part of a larger company or organization generally have a greater understanding of the need for formal policies and procedures and an appreciation for the need for occasional changes in policies, making them more likely to adapt to directives of overseas staff in a flexible, mature and responsible manner. Furthermore, such applicants are more likely to demonstrate professionalism, an essential aspect of a successful service. \n\n\n\nADDITIONAL DESIRED CRITERIA FOR SERVICE IN PC/El Salvador: \n\n• Overseas experience: PC/El Salvador prefers that assignments in El Salvador not be an applicant’s first overseas experience, especially if the applicant is a recent college graduate. All qualified applicants should have at least 12 consecutive weeks of living experience abroad. \n\n• Two years of work or volunteer experience: despite the fact that the majority of applicants are recent college graduates, it is preferable that invitees have at least two years of work or volunteer experience as follows: \n\n(1) Two years of accumulated professional experience (20+ hours a week at any job or series of jobs) during or after college (does not need to be consecutive and can include a combination of work and volunteer experience); \n\n(2) Two years of graduate school or successful completion of a graduate degree; \n\n(3) Some combination of 1 and 2; or \n\n(4) Current enrollment in a Master’s International program.",

Desired experience includes: life-skills development with youth (self-esteem, gender equality, leadership, values, career preparedness, small income generation, volunteerism, etc.). <br><br>GENERAL CRITERIA FOR SERVICE IN PC/El Salvador: <br>• Applicant understands the Pre-Service Training (PST) process will determine whether they qualify for service according to criteria established by the post. <br>• Applicant is willing to adjust individual lifestyle to adapt and follow the norms of a particularly conservative society taking necessary and appropriate measures to stay safe. <br>• Applicant understands the 24/7 nature of the representational role. <br>• Applicant has the leadership skills and propensity to guide and mentor peer PCVs towards positive behaviors conscientious of preserving the image of Peace Corps and respecting host country norms. <br>• Applicant shows genuine desire to spend time with Salvadorans over fellow U.S. citizens. <br>• Applicant demonstrates interest in service over personal priorities (e.g., over interest in traveling, tourism, etc.). <br>• Applicant understands and is willing to agree to the 27-month homestay requirement. The requirement is implemented for both security and cultural integration reasons. <br><br>Note: PC/El Salvador requires PCVs to follow policies for specific reasons. Often it can be difficult for PCVs who are accustomed to the freedoms and lifestyle of college to abide by established rules and adapt to changing policies. Applicants who understand what it’s like to have a supervisor and who have functioned as part of a larger company or organization generally have a greater understanding of the need for formal policies and procedures and an appreciation for the need for occasional changes in policies, making them more likely to adapt to directives of overseas staff in a flexible, mature and responsible manner. Furthermore, such applicants are more likely to demonstrate professionalism, an essential aspect of a successful service. <br><br>ADDITIONAL DESIRED CRITERIA FOR SERVICE IN PC/El Salvador: <br>• Overseas experience: PC/El Salvador prefers that assignments in El Salvador not be an applicant’s first overseas experience, especially if the applicant is a recent college graduate. All qualified applicants should have at least 12 consecutive weeks of living experience abroad. <br>• Two years of work or volunteer experience: despite the fact that the majority of applicants are recent college graduates, it is preferable that invitees have at least two years of work or volunteer experience as follows: (1) Two years of accumulated professional experience (20+ hours a week at any job or series of jobs) during or after college (does not need to be consecutive and can include a combination of work and volunteer experience); (2) Two years of graduate school or successful completion of a graduate degree; (3) Some combination of 1 and 2; or (4) Current enrollment in a Master’s International program. <br><br>Married Couples: If one-half of the couple meets all of the above requirements, then the accompanying spouse must meet at least the S2 language requirement.",

  "living_conditions_comments_condition_comments" : "Water & Bathrooms:  Volunteers assigned to villages may live in houses with outdoor squat-style pit latrines and may or may not have indoor plumbing for bathing.  Regardless of water availability inside homes, most rural-based volunteers will bathe using bucket baths.  Volunteers in towns or cities will most likely live in Soviet-era apartment buildings that have not been well maintained cosmetically over the past 30+ years.  They are structurally sound, have electricity, but may lack 24 hr water supply. Bathrooms may or may not have a working shower; in the later case, Volunteers will bathe using bucket baths.  Winter Heating:  Heating varies from wood or dung burning stoves in rural villages to natural gas heating stoves or central hot water radiated heating systems.  Peace Corps provides all volunteers with electric oil radiant heaters to supplement the existing heating system. Electricity:  All households for PCT/Vs in Armenia have electricity from the central grid on a 220-240 volt, 50 Hz system for both large and small appliances.  110 v 50 Hz step-down power transformers are readily available on the local market, however all modern cell phone & computer power adapters have a 110-240 v 50-60 Hz range so the transformer is not needed.  Plug adapters (flat 2-3 prong to 2-pin) are readily available on the local market.Working Conditions:  This varies considerably from urban to village sites and village to village sites.  Some facilities (schools, municipal buildings, offices, etc.) have been newly renovated while many have not.  As such, expect dilapidated structures with poor to no heating in winter; outside pit latrines on village school grounds is common.<br><br>Roads & Public Transportation:  In general, the roads are in fair to poor condition; however public transportation and taxi services are fairly reliable.  Previously asphalted rural/village roads are mostly deteriorated to dirt roads with potholes and can get very muddy during the rains.  In small villages, transportation to and from job site is by foot (bring a clean pair of shoes to change into at work), while in larger villages and towns there is public transportation via mini busses.  Transportation between villages and towns is by minibus or taxi. Telecommunications:  This service is well developed throughout the country with digital fiber optic transmission lines and three cell phone operators with nearly country-wide coverage.  All cell phone providers have 3G networks that cover over half of the country, and they provide Internet service through USB modems supporting HSPA/UMTS/EDGE/GPRS technology.  This area is changing rapidly and providers are upgrading systems and technology annually.  If Trainees want to bring a cell phone, it should be unlocked; rechargeable SIM cards are available at the many branch offices throughout the country.  Unlocked USB modems will also work with the current providers. Climate: Armenia has a highland continental climate that enjoys four seasons with short wet springs, dry hot summers, short mild autumns, and very cold winters.  It has various microclimates due to the range of elevations so expect variation from place to place and season to season.  Come prepared with warm clothing and boots for the winter months. Armenians are generally fastidious about their appearance and dress neatly even in villages. Men keep short hair and are clean shaven. The few who do have beards or mustaches tend to be over 40 years of age and generally keep them trim and neat. Women generally wear fashionable clothes and makeup. In the workplace, be it a school, NGO or other institution, PCT/Vs are expected to dress at minimum “business casual” – for men this mean collared shirts, slacks and sport coat, and for women dresses, dress suits, slacks, sweaters, collared shirts, etc. Torn and/or dirty jeans, t-shirts, tank tops, and other casual clothes are not acceptable in the workplace and most social situations.",

  "project_description_project_description" : "Background: Peace Corps began programming in the spring of 1992 at the request of the Government of Armenia to support their efforts to improve the quality of English language education in schools and universities, and assist in the transition to a market-based economy. For nearly two decades, Peace Corps had projects in small business and community development, and in 2012 turned its focus to community and youth development based on a review of country needs and changing priorities aimed at youth. As such, Peace Corps’s Community and Youth Development project (CYD) places Volunteers in communities throughout Armenia to work towards the accomplishment of two goals:<br><br>Goal 1: Increase the internal capacity and professionalism of organizations<br>Volunteers provide human and institutional capacity development assistance for Armenian organizations to improve their internal governance practices, professionalize outward-focused activities such as marketing and public relations, better assess community issues and develop strategies for their resolution, and utilize local assets and resources to progress toward financial sustainability. Volunteers may find themselves helping an organization improve its human resource management practices by assisting in writing job descriptions and implementing professional development plans for the staff. As well, they assist organizations to improve their planning, implementation, and monitoring & evaluation of community projects.<br><br>Goal 2: Implement programs that lead to positive youth development<br>Through various programs, clubs, and workshops for youth, Peace Corps Volunteers aim to transfer valuable personal and professional skills to Armenia’s youth in order to enhance their capacity as leaders in their communities, promote service-based learning, and assist with career skills development. Volunteers may organize entrepreneurship camps for youth that focus on small-business skills and business plan preparation. They might create after-school activities that teach leadership skills to youth through civic engagement and community development projects. Through leading by example, Peace Corps Volunteers can serve as coaches and mentors for the community youth.",

Although it is not guaranteed, most of the Community Services Volunteers may expect to live in a family compound.  The houses may be one- or two-roomed, thatched or corrugated iron-roofed buildings made of stone, brick or cement blocks.  Most houses do not have electricity or running water.  Most Volunteers use an outdoor pit latrine and fetch water from a stand pipe in their home compound or from a village pump a few yards from their house. Some have to go further to find a source of water, carrying water back to their homes.  <br><br>The terrain in Lesotho is mountainous and rocky. Volunteers walk long distances on rocky, uneven terrain. <br><br>If required for their job, a limited number of Volunteers may receive bicycles depending on availability and safety and security considerations.  It is more normal that Volunteers will walk from 2-6 kilometers before reaching their worksite or where they can access public transportation.<br><br>Volunteers live and work either in camp towns or rural villages. They use public transport when shopping in camp towns to purchase food supplies and when traveling to activities in different parts of the district.  The fares for buses and taxis are reasonable.  <br><br>Lesotho has four distinct seasons with hot summers to extremely cold winters. Snow falls every winter in the mountains and some foothills. Therefore, it is essential to bring warm, comfortable, and professional clothing. <br><br>Lesotho has the third highest HIV prevalence in the world, with nearly 24% of the adult population infected.  This means that a majority of the Volunteers’ colleagues,neighbors and youth with which they work are affected by HIV; some are HIV-positive, while others may be orphaned and/or caring for family members living with HIV. Peace Corps trains Volunteers on healthy coping mechanisms and expects Volunteers to be positive role models for those with whom they work and live.<br><br>While Lesotho is generally a safe country, theft and violent crime exists, and Peace Corps Volunteers have been victims of these crimes, particularly in the capital and while taking public transportation. As a result Peace Corps Lesotho has implemented strict safety and security measures, including restricting Volunteers’ travel to the capital, Maseru.",

Volunteers will help individual youth to strengthen life skills and employability, and promote civic engagement.  In addition, Volunteers help to build the capacity of service providers to provide asset-based activities for youth, network with other youth-serving organizations, and build organizational capacity, as well as to engage parents and other community adults to support youth development in their communities.

Oftentimes it can be difficult for PCVs who are accustomed to the freedoms and lifestyle of college to abide by rules and easily adapt to changing policies. Recruits that understand what it’s like to have a boss and work for a company have a greater understanding of policy changes and are more likely to adapt flexibly and maturely to directives of overseas staff. Furthermore, such recruits are more likely to demonstrate professionalism, an essential aspect of a successful service. <br><br>• Spanish Language Level: S1 language requirement although the region continues with a strong preference for S2 or higher. <br>•Phone Interviews: A Placement and Assessment Specialist will conduct a suitability phone call with all applicants that are invited to PC/SV.",

PCVs will also support initiatives to raise parents’ understanding of youth issues and of techniques for improved parenting. Some Volunteers will be the first to serve in their community. Volunteers will help local youth improve their self-esteem, life skills, leadership skills, organizational skills, vocational skills, educational achievement, and community involvement. Volunteers will typically use local schools, health posts, local governments and organized youth groups as an entry into the community and to at-risk youth.",

Living with a family is the norm in Ecuador, even for adult professionals, until they are married and have a family of their own.  Living with a family when you first arrive in your community will increase your safety, credibility and community acceptance.  Volunteers are strongly encouraged to live with a family for several months, and even throughout their service.  This is to help Volunteers better integrate into their communities and to develop a credible presence and safety net.  Volunteers are strongly encouraged and -in some cases- required to live with Ecuadorian families for the entire two years of their service, depending on their site placement.  As such, volunteers participate more fully in the culture, have greater opportunities for acceptance, and develop a sense of solidarity with their neighbors.  <br><br>Volunteers working in \"red zone\" areas in the bigger cities do not live in the community that they work, but commute to and from their work each day.  These volunteers may feel challenged by not having a strong \"sense of community\", but most volunteers report that they enjoy the sense of independence that comes from living in a larger city and not being in the \"fish bowl\" as they might be living in a smaller community.  Each job location will have its pros and cons.   It's up to each Peace Corps Volunteer to adapt into that reality and make it a positive experience.",

  "living_conditions_comments_condition_comments" : "Water & Bathrooms:  Volunteers assigned to villages may live in houses with outdoor squat-style pit latrines and may or may not have indoor plumbing for bathing.  Regardless of water availability inside homes, most rural-based volunteers will bathe using bucket baths.  Volunteers in towns or cities will most likely live in Soviet-era apartment buildings that have not been well maintained cosmetically over the past 30+ years.  They are structurally sound, have electricity, but may lack 24 hr water supply. Bathrooms may or may not have a working shower; in the later case, Volunteers will bathe using bucket baths.\n\n\n\nWinter Heating:  Heating varies from wood or dung burning stoves in rural villages to natural gas heating stoves or central hot water radiated heating systems.  Peace Corps provides all volunteers with electric oil radiant heaters to supplement the existing heating system.\n\n\n\nElectricity:  All households for PCT/Vs in Armenia have electricity from the central grid on a 220-240 volt, 50 Hz system for both large and small appliances.  110 v 50 Hz step-down power transformers are readily available on the local market, however all modern cell phone & computer power adapters have a 110-240 v 50-60 Hz range so the transformer is not needed.  Plug adapters (flat 2-3 prong to 2-pin) are readily available on the local market.\n\n\n\nWorking Conditions:  This varies considerably from urban to village sites and village to village sites.  Some facilities (schools, municipal buildings, offices, etc.) have been newly renovated while many have not.  As such, expect dilapidated structures with poor to no heating in winter; outside pit latrines on village school grounds is common.\n\n\n\nRoads & Public Transportation:  In general, the roads are in fair to poor condition; however public transportation and taxi services are fairly reliable.  Previously asphalted rural/village roads are mostly deteriorated to dirt roads with potholes and can get very muddy during the rains.  In small villages, transportation to and from job site is by foot (bring a clean pair of shoes to change into at work), while in larger villages and towns there is public transportation via mini busses.  Transportation between villages and towns is by minibus or taxi.\n\n\n\nTelecommunications:  This service is well developed throughout the country with digital fiber optic transmission lines and three cell phone operators with nearly country-wide coverage.  All cell phone providers have 3G networks that cover over half of the country, and they provide Internet service through USB modems supporting HSPA/UMTS/EDGE/GPRS technology.  This area is changing rapidly and providers are upgrading systems and technology annually.  If Trainees want to bring a cell phone, it should be unlocked; rechargeable SIM cards are available at the many branch offices throughout the country.  Unlocked USB modems will also work with the current providers.\n\n\n\nClimate: Armenia has a highland continental climate that enjoys four seasons with short wet springs, dry hot summers, short mild autumns, and very cold winters.  It has various microclimates due to the range of elevations so expect variation from place to place and season to season.  Come prepared with warm clothing and boots for the winter months.\n\n\n\nArmenians are generally fastidious about their appearance and dress neatly even in villages. Men keep short hair and are clean shaven. The few who do have beards or mustaches tend to be over 40 years of age and generally keep them trim and neat. Women generally wear fashionable clothes and makeup. In the workplace, be it a school, NGO or other institution, PCT/Vs are expected to dress at minimum “business casual” – for men this mean collared shirts, slacks and sport coat, and for women dresses, dress suits, slacks, sweaters, collared shirts, etc. Torn and/or dirty jeans, t-shirts, tank tops, and other casual clothes are not acceptable in the workplace and most social situations.",

As such the project works with the Ministry of Education and Science through the National Institute of Education (NIE) to support the English language education strategy by training teachers to use modern English language teaching methodologies and enhancing their English language use in the classroom. The overall purpose of the project is that students and teachers will gain access to personal, professional, and academic opportunities through increased English language proficiency. Defined further, the two goals of the Peace Corps’s TEFL project in Armenia are:\n\n\n\nGoal 1: Teachers will improve their overall level of effectiveness through improving their English language proficiency and implementing student-centered teaching techniques.\n\n\n\nGoal 2: Learners of English throughout Armenia will develop/improve their English language proficiency, critical thinking skills and overall academic success through improved interactive classroom instruction and extra-curricular activities facilitated by Peace Corps volunteers and their counterparts.\n\n\n\nTEFL volunteers come from a variety of backgrounds with highly advanced skills from areas such as university/school teaching, TEFL/ESL instruction, psychology, anthropology, international studies, government & law, and non-profit governance, and are placed with a primary organization conducting the activities listed above in partnership with teachers, professors, & administrators.

As a community environmental education promoters, Volunteers work at the community level in coordination with teachers, community associations and government, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Volunteers are currently concentrated in five departments: León, Chinandega, Boaco, Rivas, and Matagalpa.  \n\n\n\nNicaragua’s private, public, and non-profit sectors are concerned about the country’s rapid rate of deforestation and soil erosion that has taken place over the last 25 years. The deforestation is the result of subsistence (slash and burn) farming combined with a growing, market-based agricultural sector, woodcutting and charcoal production to produce traditional fuels. These problems are compounded due to the fact that natural resources are poorly utilized and basic, government-provided services are limited. Community initiatives to address these problems are inhibited by the low income of rural inhabitants and a lack of education related to environmental issues. \n\n\n\nThe Community Environmental Education Project has a formal agreement with MINED and as partners our organizations have the following framework.  The project''s purpose is: \"To facilitate the sustainable management of communities’ natural resources through education and community action in order to conserve the local environment and improve peoples’ livelihoods.\" Community Environmental Education Volunteers will be assigned to work with three local elementary schools. The activities they develop will work towards this purpose by focusing on the following goals:\n\n\n\nGOAL 1:  Rural school teachers will improve their technical skills to teach environmental education and primary school students will increase their knowledge and skills to conserve natural resources in their communities. \n\n\n\nVolunteers implement the following tasks to meet this goal:\n\n1. Classroom co-teaching: Volunteers demonstrate and model participatory approaches and the inclusion of environmental topics in all courses. Volunteers co-teach in public primary schools, co-plan and train teachers in participatory, community-level environmental activities to achieve this. Methodologies: classroom management, positive reinforcement, community research activities.\n\n\n\n2. Environmental-technical activities: trash separation, gardening techniques, composting, nursery establishment. \n\n\n\n3. Composting, Gardening Activities, and nurseries: Volunteers train teachers in practical skills to carry out these activities in the school.\n\n\n\nGOAL 2: Community-Based groups and organizations will have improved their technical and organizational capacity and implemented projects to conserve the local environment.\n\n\n\nVolunteers participate in the following development activities to meet this goal:\n\n1. Support community organizations in their sites: Volunteers support parent organizations, ecological brigades and/or local environmental commissions to improve their organizational capacity (i.e. annual plans, local coordination with other organizations). \n\n\n\n2.Youth ecological brigade training: Volunteers will train and facilitate the organization of groups working towards local community environmental issues.  The brigades/clubs are formed by Nicaraguan youth, ages 10-17. Activity examples include trash campaigns in the school(s) and in the community to reduce organic solid waste, environmental awareness campaigns related to the importance of sustainable household water use and celebration of World Environmental Day (June 5).\n\n\n\n3.Environmental conservation activities: environmental talks, establishment of small community fruit/wood trees nurseries or vegetable gardens with composting, reforestation campaigns, ecological/educational murals, and/or proper trash disposal.",

The requested Teacher Trainer PCVs will thus play dual roles as (1) English teachers in rural elementary schools (where they will adapt, develop, and field test effective English lessons that flesh out the Ministry's curriculum framework) and (2) resource persons who help Tongan staff develop their ability to use student centered practices (through mentoring, co-teaching, facilitating of workshops, and co-creation of curriculum materials). In support of the Ministry's emphasis on \"healthy lifestyles\" activities for students, PCVs will be encouraged to model healthy practices and integrate them with their teaching activities.

Most will not have running water or electricity.  You will likely use a kerosene lantern and a kerosene stove.  The school or community will provide some very basic household furnishings that you may supplement through use of a modest settling-in allowance provided to you by Peace Corps.  Please note well that the school or community you serve is responsible for providing your housing.  Within the basic requirements set out by Peace Corps, each Volunteer’s housing situation varies, since it is the individual communities (not Peace Corps) that provide housing.

Public transportation (within ½ to 5 km from your site) is available near most sites and in most cases goes several times a day to and from the nearest urban area or trading center.

Although it is not guaranteed, most of the Education Volunteers may expect to live in a family compound.  The houses may be one- or two-roomed, thatched or corrugated iron-roofed buildings made of stone, brick or cement blocks.  Most houses do not have electricity or running water.  Most Volunteers use an outdoor pit latrine and fetch water from a stand pipe in their home compound or from a village pump a few yards from their house. Some have to go further to find a source of water, carrying water back to their homes.  Many schools have their own teachers’ living quarters. However,Peace Corps encourages the schools to provide housing in the villages where the Volunteers are afforded more oppportunities to integrate in the communities. Most Education Volunteers will live in a family compound rather than in a school compound.\n\n\n\nThe terrain in Lesotho is mountainous and rocky. Volunteers walk long distances on rocky, uneven terrain. \n\n\n\nIf required for their job, a limited number of Volunteers (particularly Primary English Teachers) may receive bicycles depending on availability and safety and security considerations.  It is more normal that Volunteers will walk from 2-6 kilometers before reaching their worksite or where they can access public transportation.\n\n\n\nVolunteers live and work either in camp towns or rural villages. They use public transport when shopping in camp towns to purchase food supplies and when traveling to activities in different parts of the district.  The fares for buses and taxis are reasonable.  \n\n\n\nLesotho has four distinct seasons with hot summers to extremely cold winters. Snow falls every winter in the mountains and some foothills therefore, it is essential to bring warm, comfortable, and professional clothing. During school vacations,Volunteers are expected to use this time to engage more in development activities and secondary projects within their community.\n\n\n\nLesotho has the third highest HIV prevalence in the world, with nearly 24% of the adult population infected.  This means that the majority of the Volunteers’ fellow teachers, neighbors and students are affected by HIV; some are HIV-positive, while others may be orphaned and/or caring for family members living with HIV. Peace Corps trains Volunteers on healthy coping mechanisms and expects Volunteers to be positive role models for those with whom they work and live.\n\n\n\nExperience with Americorps or other community service organization is an added advantage.",

They may also assist teachers with the development of teaching materials and integrating innovative teaching techniques into their current practice. These Volunteers teach about 18 - 20 hours per week. After peer teaching for a while, some of these Volunteers start to teach on their own.  \n\n\n\nSecondary education Volunteers also spend part of their time working with teachers from neighboring village schools to help them improve their English and increase their classroom repertoire and may conduct some teacher training workshops through collaboration with inspectors of foreign languages that work at the regional or local level education offices. As with the teacher trainers and university English teachers, these Volunteers also use their English teaching to help improve the critical thinking and problem solving skills of their students.\n\n \n\nWhatever your assignment, should you accept your invitation, you will help students, teachers, and other members of your community learn to use English through such activities as supporting summer camps, assisting with Model UN projects or drama activities, contributing to newspapers, creating English language materials, and participating in community sports, arts or clubs.

You will live in a two or three-room house, most likely in a compound with a Togolese family. Some volunteer houses have tin roofs; others have straw or thatched roofs. You may not have running water or electricity at your post. Water sources in villages could be traditional wells, a borehole equipped with a pump, cisterns, a natural water source, and even rivers. Whatever your source of drinking water, you will have to treat it before use.

Some volunteers like biking these distances; others prefer local public transportation (bush taxis) to the nearest mail point, bank, and shopping locations. Given the inherent risks of travel by bush taxi, Peace Corps Togo works closely with volunteers to develop strategies that minimize the need to travel long distances. Peace Corps/Togo uses a mini-bus twice a month to transport PCVs from the northernmost city to/from Lomé.  All Volunteers are equipped with a mountain bike that is their primary means of transportation. There is a regular weekly Express Mail Service (EMS) between Lomé and mail points throughout Togo for volunteers.  Besides EMS, volunteers have post office boxes (individually or as a group).<br>In some regions, excessive drinking of alcohol may be culturally accepted and quite common among males in the community. Male volunteers, especially, might be faced with considerable pressure to join in the drinking.  If you have a problem with alcohol, you may want to consider whether or not you should put yourself in a situation where you might have to deal with somewhat constant and compelling pressure to drink. Excessive drinking is discouraged for many reasons including your health, safety and ability to be a respected member in your community and effective in your work.<br>In general, American volunteers are well appreciated and respected in Togo for their easy integration into communities.  You will make friends among your collaborators or within the community. You will find some collaborators and some villagers immediately motivated for work.

Projects include increasing local teacher’s English language competency and conversational skills, organizing teacher associations or training seminars.

Regardless of water availability inside homes, most rural-based volunteers will bathe using bucket baths.  Volunteers in towns or cities will most likely live in Soviet-era apartment buildings that have not been well maintained cosmetically over the past 30+ years.  They are structurally sound, have electricity, but may lack 24 hr water supply. Bathrooms may or may not have a working shower; in the later case, Volunteers will bathe using bucket baths.<br><br>Winter Heating:  Heating varies from wood or dung burning stoves in rural villages to natural gas heating stoves or central hot water radiated heating systems.  Peace Corps provides all volunteers with electric oil radiant heaters to supplement the existing heating system.<br><br>Electricity:  All households for PCT/Vs in Armenia have electricity from the central grid on a 220-240 volt, 50 Hz system for both large and small appliances.  110 v 50 Hz step-down power transformers are readily available on the local market, however all modern cell phone & computer power adapters have a 110-240 v 50-60 Hz range so the transformer is not needed.  Plug adapters (flat 2-3 prong to 2-pin) are readily available on the local market.<br><br>Working Conditions:  This varies considerably from urban to village sites and village to village sites.  Some facilities (schools, municipal buildings, offices, etc.) have been newly renovated while many have not.  As such, expect dilapidated structures with poor to no heating in winter; outside pit latrines on village school grounds is common.<br><br>Roads & Public Transportation:  In general, the roads are in fair to poor condition; however public transportation and taxi services are fairly reliable.  Previously asphalted rural/village roads are mostly deteriorated to dirt roads with potholes and can get very muddy during the rains.  In small villages, transportation to and from job site is by foot (bring a clean pair of shoes to change into at work), while in larger villages and towns there is public transportation via mini busses.  Transportation between villages and towns is by minibus or taxi.<br><br>Telecommunications:  This service is well developed throughout the country with digital fiber optic transmission lines and three cell phone operators with nearly country-wide coverage.  All cell phone providers have 3G networks that cover over half of the country, and they provide Internet service through USB modems supporting HSPA/UMTS/EDGE/GPRS technology.  This area is changing rapidly and providers are upgrading systems and technology annually.  If Trainees want to bring a cell phone, it should be unlocked; rechargeable SIM cards are available at the many branch offices throughout the country.  Unlocked USB modems will also work with the current providers.<Climate: Armenia has a highland continental climate that enjoys four seasons with short wet springs, dry hot summers, short mild autumns, and very cold winters.  It has various microclimates due to the range of elevations so expect variation from place to place and season to season.  Come prepared with warm clothing and boots for the winter months.<br><br>Armenians are generally fastidious about their appearance and dress neatly even in villages. Men keep short hair and are clean shaven. The few who do have beards or mustaches tend to be over 40 years of age and generally keep them trim and neat. Women generally wear fashionable clothes and makeup. In the workplace, be it a school, NGO or other institution, PCT/Vs are expected to dress at minimum “business casual” – for men this mean collared shirts, slacks and sport coat, and for women dresses, dress suits, slacks, sweaters, collared shirts, etc. Torn and/or dirty jeans, t-shirts, tank tops, and other casual clothes are not acceptable in the workplace and most social situations.",

As such the project works with the Ministry of Education and Science through the National Institute of Education (NIE) to support the English language education strategy. This involves training teachers to use modern English language teaching methodologies and enhancing their English language use in the classroom. The overall purpose of the project is that students and teachers will gain improved access to personal, professional, and academic opportunities through increased English language proficiency. Defined further, the two goals of the Peace Corps’s TEFL project in Armenia are:<br><br>Goal 1: Teachers will improve their overall level of effectiveness through improving their English language proficiency and implementing student-centered teaching techniques.<br><br>Goal 2: Learners of English throughout Armenia will develop/improve their English language proficiency, critical thinking skills and overall academic success through improved interactive classroom instruction and extra-curricular activities facilitated by Peace Corps volunteers and their counterparts.<br><br>TEFL volunteers come from a variety of backgrounds with highly advanced skills from areas such as university/school teaching, TEFL/ESL instruction, psychology, anthropology, international studies, government & law, and non-profit governance, and are placed with a primary organization conducting the activities listed above in partnership with teachers, professors, & administrators.

The expanded project goals target Malagasy middle and high school students and teachers to promote interest and facility in the English language while pursuing the original pedagogical and materials development work with Malagasy teacher counterparts. In addition to classroom teaching, you will be expected to work with local English teachers who may – repeat MAY - require English language and teaching skill upgrades. As a Volunteer posted in an under-served rural area, you will not limit yourself to your teaching and teacher support assignments. Utilizing the Community Content-Based Instructional approach and the newly developped TEFL core curriculum, Peace Corps/Madagascar Volunteers model the belief that teachers, by definition, are community development workers. As such, Volunteers and their counterparts utilize English language as a vehicle to promote awareness of community issues, to encourage the utilization of schools as a base for community activities, and to develop the future community development workers in Madagascar – its young school-age population. As native English speakers, you will be asked to teach Malagasy students a foreign language (English) that they need to communicate with visitors, foreigners and potential English speaking employers.<br><br>As an English teacher, your primary assignment will be to teach English at the lycée (High School) and /or at a CEG (Junior High School) for a minimum of sixteen (16) hours each week. Eighteen hours is the maximum for Malagasy high school teachers.  You will also work with local English teachers at your school or surrounding schools for six hours each week so that they can improve their English and learn different teaching techniques from you. You will be asked to identify a counterpart, another English teacher, with whom you can work closely to make sure that you are covering the required course content.<br><br>Additionally, you may organize evening English classes for interested community members and work with other English teachers on developing these classes into income generating activities. Several Volunteers broadcast English shows on the local radio stations, combining a mixture of music and simple English lessons for the community at large.<br><br>Another of your responsibilities will be to get to know the local communities and help with extra-curricular activities that will strengthen students’ understanding of community and their future roles in the community. Through activities such as AIDS awareness, gender equality (a new term introduced with FITU) and environment clubs, students can be encouraged to go out and help in the community and bring their learning back into the classroom.<br><br>Education Volunteers are also required to do summer vacation activities when all the Malagasy schools go on a longer vacation time from late July to early October. It will be an opportunity to follow up on your primary assignments and linking them to more hands-on activities like organizing field trips with counterparts and students or teaching English to national park workers. Some Volunteers will be called upon to help with pre-service training sessions. So, you will be asked to submit not only a vacation plan but also a consistent work plan for summer projects.",

In addition, a number of international human rights groups have expressed concern with the rise in “skinhead” activity in Ukraine, and with the increasing number of attacks and fatalities targeting individuals of African, Asian, Hispanic, or Middle Eastern heritage. Most hate crimes in Ukraine have centered on males, and occur principally in larger cities.<br><br>It may be somewhat physically challenging for Volunteers in the sense that they cannot expect modern conveniences such as elevators, so there may be stairs to climb at home and work.",

(This is in addition to the 11 weeks you will live with a family during training.) The family in your site is chosen with the help of host country co-workers in the community prior to your arrival.  Living with a family is the norm in Ecuador, even for adult professionals, until they are married and have a family of their own.  Living with a family when you first arrive in your community will increase your safety, credibility and community acceptance.  Volunteers are strongly encouraged to live with a family even throughout their service.  This is to help Volunteers better integrate into their communities and to develop a credible presence and safety net.  In some cases, Volunteers would be required to live with Ecuadorian families for the entire two years of their service, depending on their site placement.  As such, Volunteers participate more fully in the culture, have greater opportunities for acceptance, and develop a sense of solidarity with their neighbors.  \n\n\n\nVolunteers working in \"red zone\" areas in the bigger cities do not live in the community that they work, but commute to and from their work each day.  These Volunteers may feel challenged by not having a strong \"sense of community\", but most Volunteers report that they enjoy the sense of independence that comes from living in a larger city and not being in the \"fish bowl\" as they might be living in a smaller community.  Each job location will have its pros and cons.   It's up to each Peace Corps Volunteer to adapt into that reality and make it a positive experience.",

Although it is not guaranteed, most Primary English Teachers may expect to live in a family compound. The houses may be one- or two-roomed, thatched or corrugated iron-roofed buildings made of stone, brick, or cement blocks. Most houses do not have electricity or running water. Most Volunteers use an outdoor pit latrine and fetch water from a stand pipe in their home compound or from a village pump a few yards from their house. Some must go farther to find a source of water, carrying water back to their homes. Most secondary schools have their own teachers’ living quarters. \n\n\n\nThe terrain in Lesotho is mountainous and rocky. Volunteers walk long distances on rocky, uneven terrain. \n\n\n\nIf required for their job, a limited number of Volunteers (particularly Primary English Teachers) may receive bicycles depending on availability and safety and security considerations. It is more normal that Volunteers will walk from 2-6 kilometers before reaching their worksite or where they can access public transportation.\n\n\n\nVolunteers live and work either in camp towns or rural villages. They use public transport when shopping in camp towns to purchase food supplies and when traveling to activities in different parts of the district. The fares for buses and taxis are reasonable.  \n\n\n\nLesotho has four distinct seasons with hot summers to extremely cold winters. Snow falls every winter in the mountains and some foothills therefore, it is essential to bring warm, comfortable, and professional clothing. Schools are usually closed in winter and Volunteers are expected to use this time to engage more in development activities and secondary projects within their community.\n\n\n\nWhile Lesotho is generally a safe country, theft and violent crime exist, and Peace Corps Volunteers have been victims of these crimes, particularly in the capital and while taking public transportation. As a result, Peace Corps/Lesotho has implemented strict safety and security measures, including restricting Volunteers’ travel to the capital, Maseru.\n\n\n\nLesotho has the third highest HIV prevalence in the world, with nearly 24% of the adult population infected. This means that the majority of the Volunteers’ fellow teachers, neighbors, and students are affected by HIV; some are HIV-positive, while others may be orphaned and/or caring for family members living with HIV.

  "living_conditions_comments_condition_comments" : "Living Conditions:\n\nVolunteer sites vary from rural, remote areas to semi-urban communities.  Although it is not guaranteed, most of the Education Volunteers may expect to live in a family compound.  The houses may be one- or two-roomed, thatched or corrugated iron-roofed buildings made of stone, brick or cement blocks.  Most houses do not have electricity or running water.  Most Volunteers use an outdoor pit latrine and fetch water from a stand pipe in their home compound or from a village pump a few yards from their house. Some have to go further to find a source of water, carrying water back to their homes. Secondary Math teachers will not necessarily have housing in a family compound, although many secondary schools have their own teachers’ living quarters. \n\n\n\nThe terrain in Lesotho is mountainous and rocky. Volunteers walk long distances on rocky, uneven terrain. \n\n\n\nIf required for their job, a limited number of Volunteers may receive bicycles depending on availability and safety and security considerations.  It is more normal that Volunteers will walk from 2-6 kilometers before reaching their worksite or where they can access public transportation.\n\n\n\nVolunteers live and work either in camp towns or rural villages. They use public transport when shopping in camp towns to purchase food supplies and when traveling to activities in different parts of the district.  The fares for buses and taxis are reasonable.  \n\n\n\nLesotho has four distinct seasons with hot summers to extremely cold winters. Snow falls every winter in the mountains and some foothills. Therefore, it is essential to bring warm, comfortable, and professional clothing. Schools are usually closed in winter and Volunteers are expected to use this time to engage more in development activities and secondary projects within their community.\n\n\n\nLesotho has the third highest HIV prevalence in the world, with nearly 24% of the adult population infected.  This means that the majority of the Volunteers’ fellow teachers, neighbors and students are affected by HIV; some are HIV-positive, while others may be orphaned and/or caring for family members living with HIV. Peace Corps trains Volunteers on healthy coping mechanisms and expects Volunteers to be positive role models for those with whom they work and live.\n\n\n\nExperience with Americorps or other community service organization is an added advantage.",

The community or school will endeavor to provide you with a modest dwelling containing at least one room for everything or if available a living room and one bedroom with or without an area to cook, and an area to wash, and a latrine.  Often the cooking, washing, and toilet areas are located outside the primary living quarters.  Your house may be half of a simple duplex built for other school staff, or it may be some other accommodation which the community has organized, and which Peace Corps staff has approved.  It is unlikely that you will share this accommodation with anyone else unless you choose to do so.\n\nHousing conditions vary according to the resources of your school, or community.  Most will not have running water or electricity.  You will likely use a kerosene lantern and a kerosene stove.  The school or community will provide some very basic household furnishings that you may supplement through use of a modest settling-in allowance provided to you by Peace Corps.  Please note well that the school or community you serve is responsible for providing your housing.  Within the basic requirements set out by Peace Corps, each Volunteer’s housing situation varies, since it is the individual communities (not Peace Corps) that provide housing.  You should arrive prepared to happily accept what your community is able to provide.\n\nYour transportation will be by foot, bicycle, and local public transport.  Public transportation (within ½ to 5 km from your site) is available near most sites and in most cases goes several times a day to and from the nearest urban area or trading center.  Public transport is likely to be crowded, uncomfortable, and unreliable.  Peace Corps Uganda prohibits the use of motorcycles (either riding or driving) by Volunteers due to the extreme safety risks they pose.",

The houses may be one- or two-roomed, thatched or corrugated iron-roofed,  buildings made of stone, brick, or cement blocks. Most houses do not have electricity or running water. Most Volunteers use an outdoor pit latrine and fetch water from a stand pipe in their home compound or from a village pump a few yards from their house. Some must go farther to find a source of water, carrying water back to their homes. Secondary Math teachers will not necessarily have housing in a family compound. Some secondary schools have their own teachers’ living quarters. \n\n\n\nThe terrain in Lesotho is mountainous and rocky. Volunteers walk long distances on rocky, uneven terrain. \n\n\n\nIf required for their job, a limited number of Volunteers may receive bicycles depending on availability and safety and security considerations. It is more normal that Volunteers will walk from 2-6 kilometers before reaching their worksite or where they can access public transportation.\n\n\n\nVolunteers live and work either in camp towns or rural villages. They use public transport when shopping in camp towns to purchase food supplies and when traveling to activities in different parts of the district. The fares for buses and taxis are reasonable.  \n\n\n\nLesotho has four distinct seasons with hot summers to extremely cold winters. Snow falls every winter in the mountains and in some foothills; therefore, it is essential to bring warm, comfortable, and professional clothing. Schools are usually closed in winter, and Volunteers are expected to use this time to engage more in development activities and secondary projects within their community.\n\n\n\nWhile Lesotho is generally a safe country, theft and violent crime exist, and Peace Corps Volunteers have been victims of these crimes, particularly in the capital and while taking public transportation. As a result, Peace Corps/Lesotho has implemented strict safety and security measures, including restricting Volunteers’ travel to the capital, Maseru.\n\n\n\nLesotho has the third highest HIV prevalence in the world, with nearly 24% of the adult population infected. This means that the majority of the Volunteers’ fellow teachers, neighbors, and students are affected by HIV; some are HIV-positive, while others may be orphaned and/or caring for family members living with HIV. Peace Corps trains Volunteers on healthy coping mechanisms and expects Volunteers to be positive role models for those with whom they work and live.",

Volunteers support teachers in this initiative, which takes a very different approach to the previous very traditional \"chalk and talk\" teaching in use by most teachers of these subjects.  Volunteers are usually based in a single upper basic or senior secondary school (Grades 7-12), but may work between two or more schools.  They help teachers to adapt to the technology, assist in plannning lessons, observe teaching and give feedback, co-teach and give demonstration lessons.

  "living_conditions_comments_condition_comments" : "All Nicaragua volunteers must live with homestay families for the duration of the 27 month service in order to maximize community integration and a safe, productive service. Volunteers can find this very rewarding but applicants should evaluate their commitment and ability to be flexible and adaptable given this Post requirement.  \n\n\n\nRural Volunteers lack simple luxury items such as fresh vegetables, cell or internet access; city Volunteers frequently confront luxury items such as specialty foods they cannot afford.\n\n\n\nEven in larger towns and cities, Volunteers should expect to be subject to frequent, often daily water and power outages.  Fresh vegetables are not easy to find, and variety is very limited (usually carrots and cabbage).  Vegetarian diet is challenging because people don’t understand and use animal fats or broths; a balanced Vegan diet is extremely challenging and will require time and monetary sacrifices and compromises.\n\n\n\nTEFL Volunteers will work with extremely limited teaching resources in public schools (no textbooks, no chalk or teaching supplies). Creativity and initiative is needed to improve teaching conditions. Schools are often hot, dry and dusty, or hot and humid during the rainy season.\n\n\n\nTEFL Volunteers must be ready to serve in work sites ranging from small, rural towns to medium-sized cities, including departmental capitals, as well urban areas with significant English needs.  Even in larger towns and cities, they should expect to be subject to frequent, often daily water and power outages.  Rural and small towns have limited means of communication and transportation. Most TEFL sites are in medium to large cities. For many, a challenge will be language development and community integration in large touristed centers. \n\n\n\nTEFL Volunteers work with multiple teachers and often travel to outlying school sites. TEFL PCVs may travel by bus, bike or walking. A significant number of sites have extremely hot temperatures (100+) with high humidity during the rainy season and very dry, dusty conditions during the dry season.",

Volunteers can expect to have about 16 teaching hours per week. While in the classroom, Volunteers will be directly working with students, our project is based on building the capacity of each teacher through this unique one-on-one co-teaching relationship. \n\n\n\nTEFL Volunteers will work with a minimum of two experienced and/or empirical English teachers from one or more schools, primarily co-planning and co-teaching for all classroom hours and providing occasional in-service training to teachers in high schools in current methodologies, subject content and resource development, thus creating sustainable improvements in teaching that will affect generations of future students. Projects include increasing local teacher’s English language competency and conversational skills, organizing teacher associations or training seminars.  Other activities can involve forming English language clubs and resource centers, tutoring at the community level, working with youth and other community outreach activities.  Classroom management, teaching skills, Spanish language skills and community organizing experience strongly preferred.\n\n\n\nNicaragua and its citizens have numerous ties with the United States, and Nicaraguans recognize that learning English is key for personal economic opportunities and for their country's future. The Ministry of Education has made it a priority and offers strong support for this project. With Volunteers' assistance, Nicaraguan English teachers will improve their ability to prepare their students for futures that require English language skills. \n\n\n\nAs a TEFL Teacher Trainer, Volunteers have three primary goals:\n\n1) Capacity Building of public high school English teachers:\n\n• Co-plan and co-teach  to improve linguistic and methodological capacities to implement participatory activities that promote authentic communication and critical thinking\n\n\n\n2) Develop English Materials: \n\n• Work with local teachers to design English teaching materials that are relevant to students' lives\n\n• Create opportunities for professional development workshops promoting communicative language\n\n\n\n3) Community Outreach: \n\n• Offer English classes to community members\n\n• Develop life skills classes or clubs for local youth\n\n• Organize and work with community groups to implement needs-based development projects",
